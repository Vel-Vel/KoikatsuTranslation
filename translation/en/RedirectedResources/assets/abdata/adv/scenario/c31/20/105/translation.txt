「これは、凄いな……予想以上に綺麗だ……」=“This is, amazing... It's way more beautiful than I expected...”
「でしょでしょ？　ここを見つけた時、絶対[H名]と一緒に来たいって思ったんだ」=“Right, right? When I found this place, the only thing I could think of was bringing you along with me to take a look, [H名].”
「そうか、それは光栄だな。おまえにいつも思ってもらえるなんて、私は幸せものだ」=“I see, I'm really grateful. You always think of me, I feel so blessed.”
「う、うん……あれ？　なんかいつになく大人しいって言うか……もしかして泣いてる？」=“Y-Yeah... Huh? You sure became quiet all of a sudden, or rather... Are you crying?”
「ばかっ、泣いてなどいるか。夜景の綺麗さと、おまえに嬉しい事を言われて、少し胸が詰まっただけだ」=“Dummy--, like hell I'm crying. My chest just felt a little choked up, from the beauty of the view and the nice things you said to me.”
「そっか、[H名]って意外に乙女チックだよね？」=“I see, you're unexpectedly girly, huh, [H名]?”
「意外は余計だ。私の事をなんだと思っている」=“Unexpectedly" is a bit much. Just how do you even see me?”
「最高に可愛くて、大好きな俺の彼女だと思ってるよ」=“I see you as the cutest girl ever, as my beloved girlfriend.”
「なっ、そんな恥ずかしい台詞、よく言えるな？　気障ったらしいというか、おまえはナルシストか？」=“Wha--, such embarrassing lines, you sure can say them well, huh? It stinks of smugness, or rather, are you a narcissist, who loves the sound of their own voice?”
「ナルシストはやめてよ……流石に傷つく……」=“Don't call me a narcissist... It really does sting...”
「はは、すまん。でも、おまえが先に余計な事を言うからだぞ？　たしかに私は女らしくないかもしれんが……」=“Haha, sorry. But, you're the one who started it, you know? Certainly, I'm not all that girly but...”
「ご、ごめん！　そんなつもりじゃなくて……あぁ、ホントごめん……傷つけちゃった、よね？」=“S-Sorry! That's not what I meant to say... Aah, I'm really sorry... I hurt you, didn't I?”
「まったく、お手柔らかに頼むぞ。これでも女なんだ……普段の仕返しをするなら、もう少し他の方法にしてくれ」=“Jeez, go easy on me, please. At the end of the day, I'm still a girl... If you're going to hit back like usual, then at least find a different way to do it.”
「仕返しって……そんなつもりで言ったんじゃないよ。確かに[H名]は厳しいところがあるけど、そこも含めて、好きなんだ」=“Hit back"... I didn't mean it that way. It's true, you have your rough parts, [H名], but I love everything about you, even those sides.”
「好き、か……そうか、フフッ、我ながら現金だな。おまえに好きと言われると、些細な事はどうでもよくなってしまう」=“Love, huh... I see, Fufu--, that's pretty calculating of you, if I do say so myself. Everytime you profess your love for me, I find myself not giving a damn anymore about the small stuff.”
「今日の私は、少し不安定みたいだ。夜景が綺麗過ぎて、心が浮ついているのかもな」=“Seems like I'm feeling pretty insecure today. The nightsky is too beautiful, it's making my heart feel a bit restless.”
「あぁ、えっと、とにかくごめん。これからは言葉に気を付けるよ」=“Aaah, erhm, anyways, I'm sorry. I'll pay attention to my words from now on.”
「こら、そんなに縮こまるな。この話はこれで終わりにしよう。折角二人きりなのだ、もっとその……イチャつきたいだろ？」=“Hey, don't wall yourself off so much. Let's end that conversation there. We're finally alone by ourselves so, don't you want to, you know... flirt and stuff?”
「あはは、それはまぁ……そうだね。謝ってばかりじゃ、イチャつけないもんね？」=“Ahaha, that's, well... Yeah. If I keep apologizing, it won't exactly count as flirting, will it?”
「あぁ、そうだぞ。だが、おまえと付き合わなければ、こんなに女らしい感情に振り回される事もなかったのだろうな……」=“Yeah, that's right. But, if I didn't start going out with you, I probably wouldn't have been pushed and pulled around by such girly emotions either...”
「それは、[H名]にとって良い事？」=“Do you consider it a good thing, [H名]?”
「悪い気はしないな。恋をすると女は綺麗になると言うだろ？　あれは本当だ、正確には綺麗になろうとする……と言ったところか」=“It doesn't feel bad, no. Don't they say that girls become more beautiful after falling in love? It's true, though, to be more precise, it's more about... girls trying to be more beautiful.”
「メイクに、服選び、髪型、体型、全部が気になるんだ。おまえと付き合う前は、こんな事はなかった」=“My makeup, the clothes I wear, my hair style, my figure, I worry about everything. Before I met you, I never thought about it.”
「[H名]もそうだったんだ。俺も[H名]によく見られたくて、色々頑張ってるつもり……」=“So you were like that too, huh? I wanted you to look more at me too, [H名], so I've been trying my best in various ways...”
「夜景が綺麗なスポットなんて、彼女がいなければ調べなかったと思う。正直、慣れなくて苦労したよ」=“I don't think I'd have gone out of my way to look for this spot, unless I had a girlfriend. Honestly, I've never done something like this before, it was hard work.”
「そうか、それは手間をかけたな。なら、それなりのご褒美が欲しいだろう？　ほら、こっちに来い」=“I see, looks like I made trouble for you. In that case, you probably want a reward, right? Come on, come closer.”
「ご褒美って……あっ、[H名]……」=“By reward... Ah--, [H名]...”
「ん……」=“Nnn...”
「っちゅ……どうだ？　これでご褒美は足りるか？」=*kiss*... How is it? Is that enough of a reward?
「も、もちろん！　いきなりで照れたけど、足り過ぎて、色々凄い事になりそう！」=“O-Of course! You caught me off guard but, it was almost too much of a reward, I feel like everything's going to be amazing!”
「フッ、なんだそれは……あまり騒ぐな、折角のムードが台無しだろう？」=“Pfft, what's all that about... don't get too excited, this mood's gonna get ruined, no?”
「はは、やっぱり今日の[H名]はロマンチストだね」=“Haha, you really are quite romantic today, [H名].”
「私だって女だと言っただろう？　女の雰囲気に弱く、酔いやすい。夜景を探すのに夢中で、そこまでは調査しなかったのか？」=“Didn't I tell you? I'm a girl too. Girls are weak to the right mood, they get drunk on it easily. Did you not research even that much? Even though you searched for this spot in a daze.”
「うぅ、そこは調査不足だったかも……じゃあ[H名]は、こういう時、男が何をしたいかわかる？」=“Uuu, my research may indeed be lacking... then, do you know, [H名], what sort of thing boys like to do, at times like this?”
「大体予想ができるが、敢えて答えるのはやめておこう。おまえの口から、言ってみろ」=“I can take a guess but, I'll pass on actually saying the words. Try saying it with your own mouth.”
「う、うん……さっきのご褒美の話だけど、ちょっと足りなくて……もっと[H名]が欲しいんだ。深く繋がりたい」=“Y-Yeah... It's about the reward from earlier, it wasn't enough... I want you even more, [H名]. I want to be connected at a deeper level.”
「ほらな、予想通りだ。そうくると思ったよ。まぁ、実を言うと、私もシたいと思っていたところだ」=“See, just as I expected. I thought it'd come to that. Well, if I'm being honest, I wanted to do it too.”
「よかった。今度は雰囲気を大事にするよ。折角教えてもらったんだから、実践して見せないとね」=“I'm glad. I'll try to mind the mood this time. You went out of your way to show me how, I'll have to put it into practice.”
「深く……か。また上手く言ったものだな。そういう語録も、調べてきたのか？」=“Deeper... huh? You said something nice again. Did you search for those lines too?”
「いや、今のはアドリブ……っていうか、俺の素直な気持ちかな」=“No, that was improv just now... or rather, just my honest feelings, I guess?”
「そうか、なら私も本音で答えてやらないとな。外でというのは少し気後れするが、おまえに初めてを捧げたい」=“I see, then I'll have to answer that in earnest too, won't I? I'm a bit nervous doing it outside but, I want to give you my first time.”
「えっ！？　はじめてっ！？」=“Eh--?! Your first time--?!”
「そ、そうだぞ？　言っただろ、私は男っ気のない生活をしていたんだ。当然そういう事も……していない」=“T-That's right, you know? I told you, I've never been interested in guys before, in my life. Of course, I've also never done... that sort of thing.”
（まずいまずい。雰囲気を大事にしろって言われたばっかりだ。ここはなんとか余裕の態度で）=(Fuck, no good. She just told me to mind the mood too. I have to maintain my composure here)
「ンッ、[H名]の初めてを貰えるなんて光栄だよ。俺、精一杯優しくするから。一緒に気持ちよくなろう」=“Mm--, it'd be an honour, to be your first, [H名]. I'll do my best to be gentle, so let's feel good together.”
「よし。でも実際、どこでするんだ？　流石に人目に付くところは、遠慮したいぞ？」=“Alright. But, where are we really going to do it? Even for me, doing it in a place where people might see us is a bit much, you know?”
「大丈夫、そこも調査済みだから！　はは……呆れた目で見ないでよ……」=“It's alright, I also checked that out in advance! Haha... don't look at me with such exasperated eyes...”
