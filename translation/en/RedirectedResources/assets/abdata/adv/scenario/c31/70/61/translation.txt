「うぅん、顔が自然に緩んでくるな……すまん、少し浮かれているようだ」=“Mmm, my face is relaxing on its own... Sorry, I'm getting a bit too carried away here.”
「謝る事ないよ。[H名]のそういう顔見られるのは貴重だからね」=“It's nothing you need to apologize for. Being able to see such an expression on your face is really precious to me.”
「こら、からかう暇があるなら……手くらい繋いだらどうだ？　折角のデート……なのだぞ」=“Hey, if you have the leeway to tease me... How about we hold hands at least? We're on a date... you know?”
「フッ、自分から言った事だが、本当にずっと手を繋いでいたな」=“Hah, I brought it up myself but, you really did hold my hand the whole time.”
「あぁ、ごめん。その、離したくなくて……色々やり辛かったよね？」=“Aah, Sorry. That's, I didn't want to let go... Must have been hard in many ways, right?”
「そんな事は気にするな。面倒な事も含めて楽しむのが、付き合うという事だろう？」=“Don't worry about something like that. Enjoying even the annoying things, that's what it means to go out with somebody, no?”
「そうだね。そう言ってもらえると、すっごく嬉しいよ」=“You're right. Hearing you say that makes me really happy.”
「ここまで来たら、最後の最後まで離すなよ？　ど、どうしてもという時もあると思うが……何とかしろ」=“Now that we've come so far, don't let go until the absolute very end, okay? I know there are times when it can't be helped but... Just figure it out.”
「そ、それは……嬉しいような……やり過ぎなような……ははは」=“T-That's... I feel happy, yet... It feels like overkill... Hahaha.”
「よし、最後まで手を繋いでいれたな。名残惜しいが……そろそろ離すか？」=“Alright, you held my hand till the very end. It feels like a shame but... shall we let go now?”
CHOICE:「もう少しだけ、繋がっていたいな……」=I want to keep holding hands, just for a bit longer...
CHOICE:「うん、俺も寂しいけど……ここまでかな」=Yeah, I feel a bit lonely too but... let's stop here.
「もう少しだけ、繋がっていたいな……」=“I want to keep holding hands, just for a bit longer...”
「フフッ、意見が合ったな。いいだろう……もう少しだけだぞ？」=“Fufu--, looks like we're of the same mind. Why not... Just for bit longer though, okay?”
「うん、俺も寂しいけど……ここまでかな」=“Yeah, I feel a bit lonely too but... let's stop here.”
「あぁ……では離すぞ？　フッ、お互いの汗でびっしょりだな」=“Yeah... Then, I'm letting go, okay? Hah, they're drenched with our sweat.”
