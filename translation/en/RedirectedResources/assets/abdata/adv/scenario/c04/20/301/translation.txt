「カラオケに来るのは久しぶりだわ」=“It's been a while since I've come out to karaoke.”

「なるほどね」=“Makes sense.”
「早速、曲を入れましょう。あなたは歌は上手いの？」=“Let's put in some songs then. Are you good at singing?”
「うーん……普通じゃないかな？　上手いとも言われたことはないけど。[H名]は上手いの？」=“Nnn... about average, I'd say? Never really been told by anyone that I'm particularly good. Are you good at it, [H名]?”
「……ふふっ」=“...Fufu--”

「大丈夫よ。ほら、頑張って」=“It's alright. C'mon, do your best.”
