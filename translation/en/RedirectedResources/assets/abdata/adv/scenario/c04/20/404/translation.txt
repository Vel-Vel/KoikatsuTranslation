「写真で見たよりもずっと大きいね」=“It's sure way bigger than it looked in the picture.”
「そう？　こんなものよ。写真より小さいのが来るのと比べれば良心的じゃない」=“Yeah? Well, it's certainly way better than places that have servings smaller than they look in pictures, no?”
「それ、食べ切れるの？」=“You sure you can eat it all?”
「愚問ね……私がスイーツを食べきれないわけないでしょ？」=“What a silly question... Do you really think a girl like me can't go through her sweets?”
（でしょ？　と言われても知らないけど……）=(I mean, I don't know, that's why I asked...)
「はむっ……ん～、生クリームが美味しいわ」=“*bite*... Nn~, this fresh cream is so good.”
「だいぶたっぷりかかってるね」=“They really piled it on there, didn't they?”
「んっ……この濃厚な甘さ……極楽っていうのはこういうことよ……」=“Nn--... this rich sweetness... now this is heaven...”
「へぇ……そんなに」=“Hoh... it's that good, huh?”
「これにして正解だったわ……夢中になっちゃう」=“I'm glad I ordered this... this is addicting.”
「へぇ……」=“Hoh...”
「……そんなに見つめられると、食べにくいのだけれど」=“...It's kind of hard to eat, with you staring at me like that.”
「え？　ああ、ごめんごめん。あまり美味しそうに食べていたからつい」=“Eh? Aah, sorry sorry. You were just eating it so deliciously, I couldn't help it.”
「あなたにもあげるから……そんなに見ないで……ほら、あーん」=“I'll let you have some too... so stop staring... c'mon, open wide.”
「あ、あーん……」=“A-Aaahn...”
「あむっ……うん、柔らかいパンケーキにたっぷりの生クリームが良く合うね」=“*chew*... yeah, the fresh cream goes great with the soft and fluffy pancakes.”
「あなただって……ずいぶん美味しそうに食べるじゃない」=“See?... You ate that super deliciously too.”
「……あれ？　でも、甘いものは苦手じゃなかったっけ？」=“...Huh? But, didn't you not like sweet stuff?”
「こういうところのスイーツって、どこも甘い気がするんだけど」=“I feel like any sweets at a place like this would be pretty sweet.”
「はむ、はむ……これは、そんなに甘くないから平気よ」=“*chew, chew*... this isn't, all that sweet, so it's fine.”
「丁度いいバランスの渋味と甘味で、とても美味しい……。口に入れた瞬間心がほどけていく感覚がするわ」=“The astringency and sweetness are in such a perfect balance, it's simply delicious... Just putting it in my mouth makes my heart feel lighter.”
「プリンひとつにそんなにすごい力が……」=“For a simple cup of pudding to have such power...”
「なんだか俺も食べたくなってきたよ。一口だけもらえないかな？」=“Now I feel like having some too. Could I have a bite?”
「しょうがないわね。じゃあ一口。あーん……」=“Suppse it can't be helped. Just one though. Open up...”
「あーん……」=“Aaaahn...”
「むぐむぐ……うーん、確かに落ち着く。[H名]の解説を聞いたあとだと余計に美味しく感じるよ。すごいなぁ」=“*chew chew*... Nn, it really is calming. Especially after hearing your own comments, I can really appreciate how good it is. Amazing.”
「どっちを褒めてるの？　私……？　プリン……？」=“Which one of us are you complimenting here? Me...? Or the pudding...?”
「どっちも！」=“Both!”
