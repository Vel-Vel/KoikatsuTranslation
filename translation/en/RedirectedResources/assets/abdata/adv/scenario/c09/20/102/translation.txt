「いい天気！　ここまで晴れてると、気持ちいいわね」=“Such good weather! When it's this clear out, it just so feels good, doesn't it?”
「本当だね、でもさすがに天気良すぎて……ねえ、ちょっと木陰で休まない？」=“Yeah, but it's a bit too good... hey, can we rest under the tree's shade a bit?”
「確かに日差しが強烈ね……ちょっとそこのベンチに避難しましょうか」=“The sunlight is pretty harsh, yeah... let's take shelter at that bench.”
………………=.........
（ハトがいっぱい寄ってきた……ここって、いつもハトがエサもらってる場所なのかな？）=(So many pigeons... do they always get food from people sitting here?)
「……ハトは、こんなに暑いのに、倒れたりしないのかなぁ」=“...It's so hot out today, do you think pigeons get heatstroke too?~”
「あんた、変なこと気にするわね。そんなこといいから、何かこの子達にあげられるものない？」=“You sure think about some weird things. Forget about that, do you have anything we could feed them?”
「エサあげるの？」=“You're gonna feed them?”
「うん。そのつもりなんだけど……何か持ってない？」=“Yeah. That's the plan... do you have anything?”
「えーっと、確かポケットに……あったあった、ほら、クッキー」=“Eerhm, I remember putting a... ah, here it is, a cookie.”
「固くてそのままじゃ食べられないよね。細かく砕いてあげる……はい、どうぞ」=“They probably won't be able to eat it as is, would they? It's gotten so hard after all. I'll break it up into tiny pieces for them... here you go.”
「へぇ、近づいても全然逃げないや……やっぱり、いつもエサもらってるのか」=“Hoh, they're not flying away even though you're so up close to them... guess they really must be getting fed, by people here.”
（それにしても[H名]のやつ……エサやりに夢中だな……ベンチで休むんじゃなかったのか？）=(That aside, that dolt... she's so engrossed in feeding them... didn't she wanna rest in the shade?)
「……何してんの。あんたも来なさいよ」=“...What're you doing? C'mon, come here.”
「え？　今、腰を落ち着けたとこなのに……」=“Eh? I finally managed to relax some too, though...”
「もう！　年寄りじゃないんだから、休憩終わりよ」=“Jeez! You're not an old man, so move that ass.”
「……はーい」=“...Fine, fine.”
「いくわよ！　召し上がれ！」=“Here you go! Dig in!”
「うわっ！　まるごと！」=“Uwah--! You threw the whole thing!”
「あ～あ、逃げてっちゃった……」=“Aah~, they flew away...”
「え～っ！　なんで！？　せっかくエサあげたのに……」=“Eeh~! Why?! I even gave them food and everything...”
「そりゃあ、塊のまま投げたらハトもおびえるよ。逃げられて当たり前だって」=“Even pigeons are gonna get scared if throw a whole cookie at them. I don't know what you were expecting.”
「そうなんだ……ごめんね」=“I see... Sorry, birdies.”
「そんな気にするなよ。どうせまたすぐ寄ってくるからさ」=“Don't mind it so much. They're gonna come right back in no time anyway.”
