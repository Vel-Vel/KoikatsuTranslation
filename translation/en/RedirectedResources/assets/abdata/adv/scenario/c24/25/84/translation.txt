「今更かもしれませんけど、コイカツ部ってお喋りをするだけの部活じゃないですよね？」=“I know it's a bit late to ask this, but the Koikatsu club isn't just a place for us to have chats, is it?”
「うん。何かしたいことがあったら提案してもらえると嬉しいな。その、無理のない範囲で……」=“Yeah. If there's anything you wanna do in particular, I'd be happy to go along with it. Uhm, as long as you keep it reasonable...”
「うふふ♡　身構えなくても大丈夫ですよ♡　じゃあ……手を握ってもらっていいですか？」=“Ufufu♡ You don't need to prepare for a life-and-death battle like that, you know♡ Well then... could we hold hands?”
「それぐらいなら……えっ？　手、すごく冷たいよ……」=“If it's just that much... eh--? Your hand, it's freezing cold...”
「……あなたにとって『それぐらい』でも、私にとっては結構無理のある範囲なんですよ♡」=“...To you, it might be ‘just that much’, but I'm pushing myself quite a bit here, you know?♡”
（よく見たら、震えてるじゃないか……）=(Now that I look closer, isn't she's shaking...)
「そっか……ごめん。俺も握り返すね」=“I see... Sorry. I'll grip back.”
（言動は派手だけど、この子も男性に免疫がないんだよな。相手は等身大の女の子だってこと、忘れちゃダメだ）=(She may act all flashily at times but, even she isn't accustomed to being near guys, huh? I shouldn't forget that in the end, she's just a normal girl.)
