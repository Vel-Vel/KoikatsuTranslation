「今日はあなたの大好物ばっかりのお弁当を作ってきていたんです」=“I made lunch for you today, packed full of only stuff that you love.”
「わ……本当だ。……え？　もともと俺と食べるために？」=“Wah... For real? ...Eh? Were you planning on eating lunch with me today?”
「もともとは、一人あーんごっこをするためです♡　でも今日は二人あーんごっこですね♡　はい、あーん♡」=“Well, the original plan was to pretend that we were feeding lunch to each other♡ But today we can feed each other for real♡ Here you go, open up♡”
「もぐっ……」=“*Chew*--...”
（美味しい……！）=(It's so good...!)
