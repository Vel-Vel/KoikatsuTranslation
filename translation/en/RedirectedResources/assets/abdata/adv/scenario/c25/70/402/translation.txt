「はぁ～、やっと座れた～」=“Haa~, we finally got to sit down~”
「なんかすごい混んでるよね」=“It's pretty packed here, isn't it?”
「ね～、一人だったら絶対来なかったすよ～」=“Hey~, I would have never come here by myself, you know~?”
「うん、俺も待つの嫌いな方だから、一人だと別のところいくかな」=“Yeah, I hate waiting too so, if I was by myself, I think I'd have gone somewhere else.”
「並ぶの面倒くさいもんね～、あと時間ももったいないしさ～」=“It's a pain to line up, after all~, and it's a waste of time too~”
「そうだね」=“Yeah.”
「じゃあ、注文をしようか……店員さんはっと、あちゃー、遠くに行っちゃった」=“Then, let's order, I guess... the waiter is, darn, they already ran off.”
「あっ、あの制服オシャレっすね～」=“Ah--, that uniform's pretty stylish, don't you think~”
「そうだね。そういえば[H名]は……」=“Yeah. Reminds me, [H名]...”
「おしゃれとか興味あるの？　女子って男子と違って、化粧とか色々面倒だけど……」=“You have an interest in things like fashion and stuff? Unlike boys, girls' make-up seems like a massive pain...”
「まぁ、確かに面倒だけど～、ちゃんと気を使ってるよ～」=“Well, it is a pain for sure but~, I do pay attention to that stuff~”
「一応、年頃の女の子だしね～。特にファッションは大事だと思うな～」=“For what it's worth, I am a girl of that age too~. I think fashion in particular is pretty important~”
「やっぱり、そうなんだ。今日も可愛らしいもんね」=“I thought as much. You look lovely today too, after all.”
「ふふふ、ありがとう。キミのためにバッチリ決めてきたからね～」=“Fufufu, thanks. I picked all of this out just for you, after all~”
「そっか……。俺のために嬉しいよ、本当に」=“I see... For me, huh? That makes me really happy, for real.”
「……い、いえ……うぅ、見つめられて言われると、照れくさいっす」=“...I-It's nothing... Uuu, when you say that stuff while looking me right in the eyes, it's really embarrassing.”
「キミの言う通り面倒だから、あんまり興味ないかな～」=“Just like you say, it's a pain so, not really all that interested in it~”
「髪型をセットするだけでも結構、時間かかるもんね」=“Even just stuff like putting your hair in order takes a ton of time, after all.”
「うん。特に気合い入れてる子は、男子より何時間も早く起きてるらしいよ～」=“Yeah. Especially girls who go the extra mile, they get up way earlier than boys do, you know~”
「えー、それは大変だな。俺が寝てる間に陰で苦労してるんだね……」=“Eeh, that sounds like a pain. Girls work hard in the shadows while I'm sound asleep, huh...”
「でも、私は内面を重視するほうだからさ～。ほら人間、見た目よりも中身って言うでしょ～？」=“But, I'm the type to put personality first over looks myself, ya know?~ Like you know how people say to not judge books by their covers and all that~?”
「俺も内面派かな。やっぱり性格が一番、大切だよね」=“I'm the same way myself. Personality really is the most important thing, isn't it?”
「[H名]みたいな、優しい子のほうが魅力的だと思うよ」=“I think a kind, sweet girl like you, [H名], is way more attractive than others.”
「えっ、ちょっと～。無理矢理、褒めたって何もあげないすよ～……」=“Eh--, come on~. Even if you butter me up, you're not gonna get anything out of me~...”
（[H名]の照れてる姿、可愛いな……）=(She looks so cute when she's blushing...)
