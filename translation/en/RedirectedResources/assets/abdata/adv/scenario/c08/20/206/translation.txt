「やっと乗れたね」=“We finally got to go on.”
「なんだか今日は行列に並んでばっかりいたような気がするよ……」=“I feel like we've done nothing but line up for rides all day today...”
「そうだね……やっと、座って休めるよぉ……」=“Yeah... we can finally, sit and catch a breather...”
「今日も[P名]君の隣に座る！」=“[P名]-kun, I'll sit right next to you today too!”
「[H名]ちょっと暑苦しいよ……」=“[H名], it's like way too hot right now for this...”
「そんなこと言わないでよぉ、ちょっとくらい暑くたって隣同士がいいの！」=“Don't say that, even if it's a bit hot, I want us to be together!”
「あ、あそこ！　さっき私たちがいたとこだよね」=“Ah, look! That's where we were just then, isn't it?”
「ほら、人があんなに小っちゃく見える！　ごまみたい！」=“Look, everyone looks so small from here! Like a bunch of rice grains!”
「もしかしたら俺たちも、さっきはここからそんな風に言われてたのかもな……」=“We were probably being called just a bunch of rice grains like that too, from here...”
「そんな風に……って、どういうこと？」=“Like that... what do you mean?”
「俺たちがあそこを歩いてる間にも、観覧車に人が乗ってたわけだろ？」=“Back when we were walking around down there, the ferris wheel would have still had people going around in it, no?”
「そうか、その人からしたら……私たちがごまに見えてたんだぁ……」=“I see, from those people's eyes... we must have been the ones looking like rice grains...”
「えへへ、なんか想像すると面白いね」=“Ehehe, it's pretty funny when you think about it like that.”
「あはは……そうだな。俺たちは、遊園地を回ってる最中ずっとお互い近くにいたから、きっと大粒のごまに見えただろうな」=“Ahaha... yeah, it is. We were stuck to each other like glue the whole time we went around the amusement park, so we must have looked like a pretty monstrous one.”
「えへへ、今もこんなに近いよ♪」=“Ehehe, we're still stuck to each other like glue, you know♪”
「ずっと、ずっと……近くにいれたら良いのになぁ……」=“If only... we could stick so close to each other forever...”
「どうしたの、急にしみじみしちゃって」=“What's the matter, you got really quiet all of a sudden.”
「う、うん……ちょっと想像しちゃって……」=“W-Well... I just kinda start imagining...”
「想像……？　どんな？」=“Imagining...? Imagining what?”
「いつか……[P]君が私を嫌いになって、離れていく場面……」=“Imagining a scene where... in the future, you'd grown to hate me, and dumped me...”
「なんて場面を想像してるんだよ！」=“What sort of thing are you even imagining!?”
「ご、ごめん……急に不安になっちゃって……」=“S-Sorry... I just, the anxiety took hold...”
「俺が[H名]をひとりにするわけないだろ！」=“Why would I ever dump you? I obviously won't ever do that!”
「えへへ……そう言ってくれると嘘でも安心する」=“Ehehe... even though I know you're just saying that, it makes me feel better.”
「嘘なんかじゃないよ。心の底から本気で思ってる……」=“I'm not just saying that, I really do mean it. I feel that way from the bottom of my heart...”
「俺はずっと[H名]を離さない。これからもずっと近くで一緒にいるよ」=“I will never let you go, [H名]. I'll be right next to you, right up close like this, far into the future too.”
「約束できる？　ずっと隣で仲良しでいてくれるって」=“Can you promise me that? That you'll always stay right by me, and be with me forever?”
「ああ、約束するよ」=“Yeah, I promise you that.”
「……嬉しい♪　あっ、そろそろ頂上だよ！」=“...I'm so happy♪ Ah--, we're almost at the top!”
「やっぱり、ここの風景は最高だね♪」=“The view from here really is the best♪”
「ほんとだね！　見晴らしがすごいな！」=“It really is! You can see everything!”
「ありがとね……」=“...thanks, you know...”
「ん……何か言った？」=“Nn... did you say something?”
「ううん、言ってないよ、えへへ♪」=“No, I didn't, ehehe♪”
