「そう！　これが食べたかったの！」=“This is it! This is what I wanted to try!”
「はは……すごいテンション高いな。よっぽど楽しみだったのか」=“Haha... you sure are getting into it. You were looking forward to it that much, huh?”
「うんっ！　それじゃあ、さっそくいただきますっ」=“Yeah--! Well then, I'll waste no time, and dig in--”
「もぐもぐ……」=“*chew chew*...”
「んっ～！　美味ひくて、しあわせ～！　さすが話題のパンケーキ！」=“Nn~! This pancake, it's so good, it's pure bliss~! No wonder it's the talk of the town!”
「特にこのクリーム！　他のお店のと違って濃厚だよぉ！」=“Especially this cream! Unlike other places, it's so rich!”
「ほら、ほっぺたほっぺた、クリームついてるぞ」=“Hey, c'mon, your cheek, you've got cream on your cheek.”
「えぇ！　嘘ぉ！」=“Eeh! No way!”
「じっとして、とってあげる」=“Stay still, I'll clean it off for you.”
「あ、ありがとう…」=“T-Thanks...”
「じゃあ、お礼に一口あげるね！」=“Well then, I'll feed you a bite as thanks!”
「はい、あーんして♪」=“Here, open up♪”
「あーん……」=“Aahn...”
「もぐもぐ……うん、おいしいよ」=“*chew chew*... yep, it's delicious.”
「えへへ、[P名]君も幸せな顔になったぁ♪」=“Ehehe, your expression's full of bliss now too♪”
「うーん、このなんとも言えない渋み……人気の抹茶プリンは最高だよぉ♪」=“Mmm, this indescribable astringency... this matcha pudding is popular for a reason, it's awesome♪”
「そんなに美味しいのか？　ちょっと一口頂戴！」=“Is it that good? Lemme have a bite!”
「うん、いいよぉ。はい、あーん♪」=“Yeah, alright. Here, open wide♪”
「あ～ん……」=“Aahn~...”
「うん……うん……へぇ～、全然甘くないんだな」=“Mmm... mmm... hoh~, it's not sweet at all.”
「でしょ、でしょ？　そこがいいんだよね～」=“Right, right? That lack of sweetness is great, don't ya think?~”
「そういえば、[H名]って甘いものはあんまり食べないって言ってたっけ」=“Come to think of it, you did say before that you don't really eat sweet stuff all that much, didn't you?”
「うん……虫歯になるのは嫌だから……」=“Yeah... I don't want to get any more cavities...”
「ははは……そうか」=“Hahaha... I see.”
（虫歯が嫌ならこのプリンも遠慮した方がいいと思うけど……言わぬが花だな）=(I feel like she shouldn't be overdoing it with this sort of pudding either, if she's trying to avoid cavities... but well, silence is golden.)
