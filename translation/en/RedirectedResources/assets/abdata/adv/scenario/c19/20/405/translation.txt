「すごい……玉子がふわふわ」=“Amazing... the egg's so fluffy.”
「……ねえ、[P名]君はオムライスを頼むのって、子供っぽいと思う？」=“...Hey, do you think it's childish of me, to get the omurice, [P名]-kun?”
「そんな事無いよ。お子様ランチのイメージもあるけど、オムライス専門のお店も多いくらいだし」=“Not at all. It does have the image of belonging to the kids' menu but, there's lots of shops out there that have their omurice as the featured dish too.”
「良かった。そういえば本で読んだんだけど、オムライスって、お腹の弱い常連のお客さん向けに作った料理が発祥のひとつなんだって」=“Thank goodness. That reminds me, I read in a book once, that one of the suspected origins of omurice is that it was initially made by a restaurant specifically for regulars with weak stomachs.”
「そうだったんだ。だからお子様ランチでも定番なのかな」=“I see. Maybe that's why it's so standard on kids' menus.”
「見た目も可愛いし、消化にも良さそうだもんね。それじゃあ、いただきます」=“It looks just adorable, and seems like it'd be easy to digest too. Well then, I'm digging in.”
「……ん～、おいしいっ。お口の中で玉子とライスがほろほろしちゃう」=“...Nn~, delicious--. The egg and rice is just melting in my mouth.”
（[H名]は本当に美味しそうに食べるなぁ……。見てて飽きないや）=(She always eats food so deliciously... Can never get bored of looking at her.)
「……や、やだ。あんまり食べてる姿を見ないで。恥ずかしい……」=“...G-Gosh. Don't stare at me so much while I'm eating. It's embarrassing...”
「そうだ……。よかったらあなたも一口、食べてみて？」=“Right... Do you want to try a bite as well?”
「え、俺も？　いいの？」=“Eh, really? You sure?”
「うん。だって、できればあなたにも同じ感動を味わってほしいし……」=“Yeah. I mean, I'd love it if I could get you to savour the same sensations as me...”
「そういうことなら是非」=“By all means then.”
「それじゃあ……あ～んして？」=“Well then... open wide~?”
「うん。あ～ん……」=“Okay. Aaahn~...”
「……おお、これは美味しい。玉子は完熟なのにふわふわしてるし、チキンライスも濃すぎず……食べやすいね」=“...Ooh, it's delicious. The egg's so soft and fluffy even though it's fully cooked, and the chicken rice is full of flavour too... goes down real easy.”
「でしょ？　ふふっ、[P名]君と感動を共有できてよかった」=“Right? Fufu--, I'm glad I was able to share this sensation with you, [P名]-kun.”
「でも……やっぱり、同じスプーンを共有するのは照れくさいね。どんなお料理も美味しすぎるくらいになっちゃいそう……」=“But... sharing the same spoon too, is really quite embarrassing, isn't it? Feel like it could make just about anything taste phenomenal...”
