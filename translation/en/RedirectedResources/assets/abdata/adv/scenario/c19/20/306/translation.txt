「っと。さて次、[H名]は何を歌う？」=“So then, what are you gonna sing, [H名]?”
「私、もう知ってる歌はほとんど歌ってるの。あとはあなたがずっとマイク持っていていいよ」=“I've already sung most of the songs I knew. You can keep holding onto the mic for the rest.”
「あなたの歌に耳を傾けるの、好きだから」=“I love listening to you sing, after all.”
「うーん……」=“Mmm...”
CHOICE:『二人で歌おう』=Let's sing together.
CHOICE:『帰ろうか』=Let's go home.
「じゃあ、二人で歌える歌を歌おうよ」=“Then, let's sing a song we can both sing together.”
「デュエット曲のこと？　私、あんまり知らないけど……」=“You mean a duet? I don't really know many songs like that...”
「そうかな？　俺と[H名]とじゃないと歌えない歌があるじゃない」=“You think so? There's a song that only the two of us can sing together, no?”
「それって……た、確かにあの歌はそう、だね……」=“That's... t-that song would be, that, wouldn't it...”
「でしょ？　[H名]の歌声……聴かせてほしいな」=“See? You remember it. I'd love to... hear your voice, [H名].”
「うん……あなにだけ、届けるから……優しくリードしてね？」=“Okay... you're the only one, it'll reach to so... lead me gently, okay?”
「流石に一人で歌い続けると喉が潰れちゃうし、[H名]が歌わないなら帰ろっか」=“Singing for the rest of the slot by myself really would kill my throat, if you've had enough then let's go home.”
「うん。今日はいっぱいあなたの歌を聴けて、幸せだった……」=“Okay. I'm really happy, I got to hear you sing so much today...”
「ははは、嬉しいけど俺の歌なんて大したものじゃないでしょ」=“Hahaha, my singing really isn't much to write home about, not that I'm not happy about the compliment.”
「大好きな人の歌だもの、そんなことないわ」=“It's the singing of the person I love so much, so really, that's not true.”
（そう言われると照れくさいな……）=(Man, she's gonna make me blush...)
