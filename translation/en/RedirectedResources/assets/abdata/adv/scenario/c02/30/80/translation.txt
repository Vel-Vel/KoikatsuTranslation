「うふふ、味気ないランチも、テーブルを囲む相手次第でごちそうに変わりますわよね」=“Ufufuh, even such a dull lunch, turns into a hearty feast depending upon your table partner, doesn't it?”
「味気ない、かなぁ……美味しいけど」=“Dull?... I mean it's pretty delicious to me.”
「もう、話の要点はそこじゃありませんわ。本当にニブいお方っ」=“Jeez, that was not the point I was emphasizing. Truly a dull man--”
「ふふふ、わかってるよ。一緒に食べると美味しいよね～。やっぱり相手次第だよ」=“Fufufuh, no, I know. Eating it together makes it delicious, doesn't it?~ It really does depend on the partner.”
「おーっほっほっほ、当然ですわ！　なにせ、このわたくしと一緒なんですもの！」=“Ohohohoh, of course! After all, it is none other than me you are eating with!”
「……食事中に高笑いはちょっと…………」=“...If you could give that laughter a rest while we're eating at least...”
