「うぁ、解答欄が一個ズレてた……」=“Uwah, my answer column is off by 1 row...”
「はぁ、貴方らしいミスね。注意力散漫、三歩どころか三秒で全て忘れてるんじゃない？」=“Haa, that's just like you. With your mind wandering around, forget 3 steps, you can't remember anything past 3 seconds, can you?”
「うぅ、テストの時は気を付けないと……うっかりじゃ済まないからね……」=“Uu, I'll need to be careful during exam season... Can't be this careless...”
「気を付けても無駄よ。愚鈍な貴方が、そう簡単にうっかりを直せるとは思えないわ」=“It's hopeless even if you try to be careful. With how dim-witted you are, I don't think it'll be so easy to for you to fix your carelessness overnight.”
「ぐっ、そう言われちゃうと……何かいい方法ないかな？」=“Guh--, If you say that... Is there no good way?”
「簡単よ、貴方が何かミスする度に、私が頬を抓ってあげる。動物の躾と同じよ、痛みで覚えるの」=“It's simple, everytime you make a mistake, I'll pinch your cheek. It's the same as training an animal, remembering via the pain.”
