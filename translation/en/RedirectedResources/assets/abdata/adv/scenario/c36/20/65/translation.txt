「貴方と並んで帰るなんて、不思議な気分ね。ほら、何か面白い話の一つでもしなさい」=“Walking home alongside you like this, it's quite the weird feeling. Come on, say something interesting, even just an opener.”
「えっ！？　えっとぉ……いつもは誰と帰ってるの？」=“Eh--!? Uhmmm... Usually, who do you go home with?”
「特にいないわよ。誰かと一緒に帰る事自体が珍しいわね。で？　これが面白い話なの？」=“No one in particular. In the first place, going home with anyone is pretty rare for me. So? Is this the "interesting" conversation you came up with?”
