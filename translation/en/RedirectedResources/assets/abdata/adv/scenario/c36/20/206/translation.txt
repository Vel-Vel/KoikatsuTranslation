「はぁっ、かなり歩いたわね。足でも揉んでもらおうかしら」=“Haa--, We've walked quite a bit, haven't we? Maybe I should have you rub my feet.”
「うん、いいよ。じゃあ、足をこっちに……」=“Yeah, that's fine with me. Then, Put your feet here...”
「バカ、冗談よ。観覧車の中はマッサージルームじゃないわ」=“You idiot, it was a joke. The ferris wheel car isn't a massage parlor.”
「でも……前は何をしても良いって言ってくれたのに……」=“But... Didn't you say before, that anything was fine...”
「そう何度も美味しい思いは出来ないのよ。特に貴方みたいな、お調子者はね」=“How many times are you going to pull that card? You can't always get your wish everytime. Especially since you tend to push your luck a lot.”
「ぐっ……密かに期待してたのに……」=“Guh... I had my hopes up in secret...”
「ほら、そんな事より、この夜景を見に来たのでしょう？　きちんと見なさい」=“Come on, rather than that, we came to look at this night sky, no? Pay attention to it.”
「うぅ、夜景も綺麗だけど……俺の中で、観覧車は[H名]さんが優しくしてくれる場所なんだけどなぁ……」=“Uuu, the night sky is certainly beautiful but... I thought inside the ferris wheel was the one place where [H名]-san was willing to be kind to me...”
「はぁ、これだもの……だから無闇にご褒美をあげたくなかったのよ」=“Haa, this is exactly what I meant... this is why I didn't want to rashly reward you last time.”
「あー、じゃあさ、今日は[H名]さんが俺に甘えるっていうのはどう？」=“Aah, then, how about you act like a spoiled child today, [H名]-san?”
「どうって……貴方に私が受け止められるの？　とてもそうは見えないわねぇ」=“How about", you say... You think you have what it takes to catch me? Sure doesn't look that way to me”
「大丈夫！　どーんと来てよ！　ちゃんと受け止めるから」=“It's fine! Come at me! I'll catch you properly!”
「ふぅん、じゃあ、遠慮なくいくわよ？　それっ」=“Hmmm, Then, I won't hold back, okay? There--”
「おぉっ、ホントに来たっ！」=“Ooh--, you really did come--!”
「何よ、貴方が来いって言ったのよ？　んぅ、それにしても、やっぱり汗臭いわね」=“What, you were the one who told me to come at you. Nnu, but seriously, you reek of sweat.”
「はは……観覧車に乗る前に、シャワーを浴びてたら変だからね」=“Haha... Well, it would be weird to shower before entering the ferris wheel, no?”
「あぁ、そういう事なら、今度は温泉にでも行きましょうか？　流石の貴方でも、臭くなりようが無いでしょ？」=“Aah, in that case, should we go to a hot spring next? Even you of all people should stop smelling after that, no?”
「そ、それはまぁ……[H名]さんと温泉かぁ～。うわ、想像しただけで、かなりイイよっ！」=“W-Well that... A hot spring visit with [H名]-san, huh~. Uwah, even from just what I can imagine, it sounds great--!”
「何を想像しているのか知らないけど、やっぱり今の話は無しにした方が良さそうね」=“I don't know what's going through your head right now, but looks like it'd be better to scrap that idea.”
「え゛っ！　なんで？　臭くない俺と、ずっと一緒にいられるんだよ？」=“Eh--! Why? We could be together all the time if I didn't smell, no?”
「は？　もう臭くてもいいわ。いい加減貴方の匂いにも慣れたもの」=“Hah? I don't care even if you smell. I'm already quite used to it afterall.”
「えへへっ、そう言われると嬉しいな」=“Ehehe--, Hearing you say that makes me happy.”
「はぁ……ほら、気持ち悪い事ばかり言ってないで、私を甘えさせるんじゃなかったの？」=“Haa... Come on, don't only talk about these gross things, weren't you going to spoil me?”
「そうだった。えっと、どうしよっか？　俺、どうしたらいい？」=“That's right. Uhm, What shall we do? What would you like me to do?”
「ふぁっ……少し疲れたわ。私は寝るから、ちゃんと体を支えてなさい……それじゃ、おやすみ」=“*Yawn*... I'm a bit tired. I'm going to take a nap, so diligently support my body... Well then, good night.”
「わぁっ、待って！　寝るって、え？　夜景、見ないの？」=“Wah--, Wait! Sleep, Eh? Are you not going to look at this scenery?”
「ねぇ、[H名]さん？　[H名]さ……」=“Hey, [H名]-san? [H名]-sa...”
「……ウボッ！？」=“...uboh--!?”
「煩いわよっ。主の眠りを邪魔するなんて、万死に値するわ」=“You're being way too annoying--. Disturbing your master's sleep is a crime punishable by death.”
「ぇぐっ、ぉふっ……だからって、いきなり鳩尾は……反則っ……」=“Guh--, Oof--... Even so, a sudden assault right on the solar plexus is... against the rules...”
「はぁっ、丁度いい枕ねぇ……毎日これで寝ようかしら……」=“Haa-- Such a perfect pillow... Maybe I'll sleep on this everyday...”
「ぁっ、ホントに寝るの？　はは、それじゃあ可愛い寝顔を……」=“Ah--, Are you really going to sleep? Haha, then, I'll take a picture of your cute sleeping face...”
「……オグッ！？」=“... Oguh--!?”
「ぉふっ、正確に同じところを……グッ、俺まで、意識飛びそう……」=“Oof--, The same exact spot too... Guh--, Even I'm going to lose consciousness at this rate...”
