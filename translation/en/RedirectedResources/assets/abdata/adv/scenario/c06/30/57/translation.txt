「あれ！？　もう来てたのか！」=“Huh?! You were already here?!”
「お早う御座います。貴方こそ、ずいぶんとお早いお着きですね」=“Good morning. You got here quite early yourself.”
「なんか、ソワソワして落ち着かなくてさ。ん？　ちょっと待って」=“I couldn't keep myself still, you see. Nn? Hang on a second.”
「確かここまで一時間以上かかるんだよね？　相当早起きだったんじゃない？」=“It should have taken you at least an hour to get here from your home, right? Did you wake up that early today, for this?”
「いいえ。いつも通り５時に起床いたしました。身支度に時間がかかってしまったので、遅いぐらいです」=“Not at all. I rose out of bed at 5, as I usually do. It took quite some time for me to dress myself, so if anything, I was almost late.”
（身支度に……それって凄く楽しみにしてくれてるってことだよな。今日は目一杯楽しんでもらわなきゃ！）=(Dress herself... so it wouldn't be wrong to say she was really excited, huh? Guess I'll have to show her an amazing time today then!)
「いっぱい遊んでお腹すいちゃったよね。何にしようか……ん？　どうしたの」=“We've been running around so much I'm running on empty. Let's see, what should I get... Hm? What's wrong?”
「いえ、これが皆様がよく行く茶店というものなのですね」=“No, this is the tea house everyone sings the praises of, isn't it?”
「さてんって……あ、もしかして来たことなかった？」=“Tea house... ah, have you never been here before?”
「ええ。もし宜しければ、貴方のお勧めの料理を注文してくださいますか」=“Yes. If it's alright, could I ask you to order in my stead, something you would recommend?”
「わかった。ここのおススメはね……」=“Got it. Something I'd recommend, huh...”
「本日は誠にありがとうございました。まさか食後の甘味までいただけるなんて……お作法は間違えておりませんでしたか？」=“Thank you very much for today, truly. To think there would even be a sweet dish after the meal... I did not step out of my bounds there, did I?”
「あはは、作法なんて気にしなくていいんだよ。美味しかったなら、それでいいんだ」=“Ahahah, not at all, you don't need to worry about that stuff. As long as you liked it, that's all that matters.”
「世の中にはまだ私の知らないことが沢山あるのですね。また誘っていただけたら幸いです」=“There are many things about this world that I still yet am not aware of, aren't there? I hope you can take me out again.”
「うん！　これからも色々なところに連れてくよ。それじゃ、また学園で会おうね！」=“I will! I'll take you to all sorts of places with me. Alright, see you at school!”
