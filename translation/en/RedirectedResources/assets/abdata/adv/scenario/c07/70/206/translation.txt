「ふぅー、ずいぶん歩き回ったから、ちょっと疲れちゃったなぁ」=“Fuu, I'm a bit tired from all that walking we did.”
「今日はすごく混んでたもんな。人混み抜けるのも一苦労って感じでさ」=“It was really crowded today, wasn't it? A pain just to make your way through the massive tide of people.”
「そうそう、今日ずっと一緒にいたはずなのに、やっと二人っきりになれたって感じがするね」=“Yeah, exactly. Even though today ought to have been a day together for us, I feel like we finally have some alone time now.”
「はは、確かに。そう思うと、こうしてゆっくり楽しむ乗り物ってのもいいよな」=“Haha, for sure. Thinking about it like that, this sort of slow, easy going ride is nice too, isn't it?”
「まったりできるね」=“Can just lounge about, yeah.”
「そうだな～。……ふぅあ～、っといけね、あくびが出ちゃったよ」=“Yeah~. ...Fuah~, damn, no, a yawn forced its way out.”
「ははは、[H名]にはやっぱりちょっと退屈かな？」=“Hahaha, this really is a bit too boring for you, huh?”
「ち、ちげーよ。なんかこう、ほっと一息ついたら、気が緩んじゃったんだよ」=“T-That's not it. It's just, my body relaxed on its own, now that we have some breathing room.”
「それじゃ、ゆっくり休んでようか。たまにはいいよね、こんな感じも」=“Well then, let's take this time to unwind. This sort of thing is nice too, every once in a while, no?”
「ああ……別に[P名]がいればなんもしてなくたって、退屈なんてしねーからさ……」=“Yeah... so you know, I don't really feel bored, as long as you're with me, even if we don't do anything...”
「[H名]……なんか、かわいいね」=“[H名]... you're really cute.”
「んなっ！　なんだよ急に！」=“W-Wha--! What's with that, all of a sudden!”
「いやね、元気いっぱいな[H名]も魅力的だけどさ、今こうして落ち着いてる時もまた、かわいいなって思ってさ」=“Well, it's just, you're really charming when you're full of energy too but, I just couldn't help but think this sort of calm side of yours was really cute too.”
「なんだよそれ。結局[P名]もおしとやかな女が好きなんじゃねーか」=“What's with that. So in the end, even you of all people prefer those sorts of refined girls, huh?”
「そ、そんなことないよ！」=“N-Not at all!”
「本当か？　焦ってるあたり、怪しいな？」=“Are you sure? You sure were in a hurry to deny it, that sounds pretty suspicious in my opinion.”
「いや、そうじゃなくてさ……強くて元気いっぱいだけど、か弱いところを隠し持ってたり、男勝りなように見えて、実は乙女チックだったり……」=“No, that's not it at all, you see... you're always so full of energy, but have a hidden delicate side under that tough exterior, you seem like a man from a casual glance but, have the heart of a maiden inside...”
「そんな[H名]が好きなんだよ」=“That's what makes you into you, and I love it.”
「それは……褒めてるのか？」=“Is that... a compliment?”
「当たり前だろ。全部かわいいんだから」=“That should be obvious. All your sides are cute to me.”
「ふふっ……一応、ありがとうと言っておくよ」=“Fufu--... Well, I will say thanks, for what it's worth.”
「ん？　信じてないな？」=“Hm? You don't believe me, do you?”
「信じてるって。私も似たようなこと、思ってるから」=“I do, I do. I feel the same way, after all.”
「似たようなことって？」=“The same way?”
「子供っぽいところがあるけど、いざとなったら頼れる感じとか、ダサいかと思ったら、急にかっこよくなるとか……」=“Full of immaturity, but reliable when push comes to shove. Uncool seeming at one moment, but suddenly cool as all heck...”
「それって、俺のこと？」=“Are you uh, talking about me?”
「……そ、そうだよ！　他に誰がいんだよ！」=“...O-Of course! Who else would I even say that about!”
「うーん、褒められてるのかよくわからないな……」=“Mmm, I can't really tell whether that was supposed to be a compliment or not...”
「だろ？　そんなもんなんだよ、きっと」=“See? It's that sort of thing, I'm sure.”
「そんなもん？」=“That sort of thing"?”
「だからさ、好きになる部分ってのは、わかりやすい長所ばかりじゃないんだなってこと」=“You know, the parts of someone you fall in love with don't always have to be obvious virtues and all.”
「そっか、そうだね」=“I see, you've got a point.”
「私だって……短所に見える部分も含めて[P名]のこと、ちゃんと好きだし……」=“Even I... love you for what you are, even with all your faults...”
「……ダサくても？」=“...Even if I'm uncool?”
「う、さては気にしてるな？　意外と根に持つタイプか？」=“Urgh, is that still on your mind? Are you the type to hold a grudge?”
