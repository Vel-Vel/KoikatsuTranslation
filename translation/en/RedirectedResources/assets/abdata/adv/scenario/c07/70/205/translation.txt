「おー、見ろよこの景色！　すげーなぁ！」=“Ooh, look at this sight! It's amazing!”
「ウキウキだね、[H名]」=“You're sure in a good mood, [H名].”
「いや、実を言うとさ……ちょっと憧れてたんだよな。こうやって二人で観覧車に乗るってやつに」=“Well, you see... I've always looked forward to this sort of thing. Riding the ferris wheel together like this.”
「そうなんだ」=“That so, huh.”
「あー、今バカにしたろ！　私にはそんなロマンチックなの、似合わないって思ってんのか？」=“Ah, you laughed inside just now, didn't you! You think I'm too boorish for this sort of romantic stuff?”
「そんなこと思うわけないだろ。そもそも観覧車に誘ったのは俺なんだから」=“Of course not, you know I would never think that. In the first place, I was the one who invited you to join me in this place.”
「俺は、[H名]と二人で乗りたいって思ったから誘ったんだ」=“I invited you because I wanted to ride it with you, [H名].”
「そっか……ありがとう。……ふふ、なんか不思議だな」=“I see... thanks. ...Fufu, it's still so incredible to me.”
「不思議、って？」=“What is?”
「ほら、私っていつもこんなんだろ？　そのせいか、女子からしか告白されたことがないんだよ」=“I mean, you know, I'm always like this, right? I wonder if it's because of that or what but, I've never been confessed to by anyone except girls.”
「モテモテだもんね、[H名]は」=“You're very popular, after all.”
「コラ、茶化すな。……まあ、んなわけでさ、男とはずーっと無縁だったんだよ」=“Come on, don't poke fun at me. ...Well, because of that, me and boys were completely separate existences, never to meet.”
「……これから先も、ずっとずーっと無縁なんだと思ってた……」=“...I thought things would forever stay like that...”
「[P名]と出会うまでは、な……」=“Until I met you, that is...”
「……」=“...”
「だから、今こうして[P名]と二人でいられることが不思議なんだ」=“What I'm trying to say is, just being able to be together with you like this, is still very incredible to me.”
「いくら憧れても……絶対来ないって思ってた未来だから……」=“After all, no matter how much I wanted it... I never thought this sort of future would ever come true for me...”
「[H名]……」=“[H名]...”
「な、なんだよ？」=“W-What?”
「んんっ……」=“Nnn--...”
「ん……」=“nn...”
「……んはっ。い、いきなりなんて、びっくりしたじゃねーか！」=“...Nnha--. Don't do that so suddenly, you nearly gave me a heart attack!”
「いや急にキスしたくなっちゃってさ。嫌だった？」=“Well, I just couldn't help but want to kiss you suddenly. Did you hate it?”
「嫌なわけ……ねーだろ……ちょっと、もう一回やってくれないか？」=“You know I would never--... hate it... won't you do it one more time?”
「今度はゆっくり、じっくりとだ。なんなら背中に手も回せ」=“Slowly and thoroughly, this time. If you feel like it, rub my back too.”
「はは、注文が多いな……わかったよ」=“Haha, someone has a lot of orders today... Got it.”
「んっ……」=“Nn--...”
「んんっ……ぁ……」=“Nnnn---... ah......”
「[H名]……これでいい？」=“[H名]... was that fine?”
「……ま、まあまあだな」=“...I-It was so-so.”
「はは、厳しいなぁ……ねぇ、[H名]」=“Haha, that's pretty harsh... hey, [H名].”
「なんだよ？」=“What?”
「もうちょっと、このままでいてもいい？」=“Can we stay like this, just for a bit longer?”
「……せっかくの夜景が見えないぞ」=“...We won't be able to see the beautiful night sky, you know?”
「俺は夜景よりも、[H名]とこうしていたいんだよ」=“Forget the night sky, I want to stay with you like this, [H名].”
「……し、しゃーないな。ちょっとだけだぞ」=“......G-Guess it can't be helped. Just for a bit, okay?”
「[H名]……俺も[H名]と一緒にいられるのは、すごく不思議な感じがするよ」=“[H名]... It feels really incredible for me too, you know, to be together with you like this.”
「そう……なのか？」=“Is that... so?”
「ああ、だってこんなに幸せだ……」=“Yeah, I mean, I feel so happy right now...”
「こんな幸せが、この世にあるなんて、思ってもみなかったよ」=“I never even thought, that there could be happiness like this in the world.”
「ははっ、相変わらず大げさだな[P名]は。恥ずかしいこと言いやがって……」=“Haha--, you never change, do you, [P名]? Always saying such exxagerated and embarrassing things...”
「[H名]は、どう？」=“What about you, [H名]?”
「どう、って何がだよ？」=“What about me?”
「ちゃんと幸せ？」=“Are you happy?”
「い、言わなきゃダメか……？」=“D-Do I have to say it...?”
「言ってほしいなぁ～」=“I want to hear it~”
「うー、もう……耳元でそんな甘えた声出すなよ……」=“Uuu, jeez... Don't whisper it like that in my ear...”
「心配しなくたって……私も充分幸せだよ……言わせんなバカ。恥ずかしい……」=“You don't need to worry... I'm plenty happy too... Don't make me say this stuff, dummy. It's embarrassing...”
