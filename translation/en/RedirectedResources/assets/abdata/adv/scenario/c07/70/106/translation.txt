「いやー、いつ来てもいい景色だなー！」=“Man, no matter how many times we come here, this view always looks just as good!”
「ホント、何度見ても飽きる気がしない」=“For real, it never gets old.”
「こうして並んで夜景を見てると、いかにも恋人って感じがして、いいよな」=“Man, just looking at this sky together, side by side, really sets in that we're a couple. It's really nice, don't you think?”
「そうだね。なんなら、もっと恋人らしくしようか？」=“Yeah, it's nice. If you're up for it, wanna get even more lovey-dovey?”
「もっと、って？」=“even more"?”
「例えば……至近距離で見つめ合ったり」=“For example... Looking into each other's eyes, at point blank.”
「お、そうだな……確かにこれは恋人っぽいな」=“Oh, sounds nice... yeah, this really does feel romantic.”
「そしてほら、俺たちが両手を繋ぎ合えば……」=“And then, if we join our hands together like so...”
「か、完璧だ……！　付け入る隙はないってくらい完璧だ！！」=“I-It's perfect...! It's so perfect, I have nothing to pick apart!”
「さらに愛の言葉を囁く」=“And I'll go one step further, and whisper sweet nothings to you.”
「マ、マジか……！？」=“F-For real...!?”
「……愛してるよ、[H名]」=“...I love you, [H名].”
「う……うん」=“Y...Yeah.”
「ほら、[H名]も」=“Come on, you too.”
「えっ……私も？　じゃあ……愛してるよ」=“Eh--... me too? Then... I love you.”
「ふふ、ありがとう」=“Fufu, thanks.”
CHOICE:『エッチしたくなってきたんだけど……』=『I've suddenly started feeling horny...』
CHOICE:『またここに来ようね、二人で』=『Let's come here together again, sometime.』
「ところでさ、エッチしたくなってきちゃったんだけど……」=“By the way, I've suddenly started feeling horny so...”
「うおい！　直接的すぎるぞ！　完璧なムードが台無しじゃねーか！」=“Woah! That's way too direct! You've went and ruined that perfect mood you had going there!”
「こう、盛り上がってきちゃって」=“Well, I can't help it, I'm getting into it.”
「やっぱスケベだなー[P名]は」=“You really are a pervert, [P名].”
「恋人らしいことといったら、エッチで決まりでしょ」=“Well I mean, when you say "lovey-dovey stuff", you can't exactly forget about sex, now can you?”
「調子いいよなーまったく」=“Well aren't you on a roll today.”
「ダメかな？」=“We can't?”
「ダメじゃねえよ……私もちょっとドキドキしてたし……」=“I didn't say that... I was starting to get into it myself too...”
「[H名]……向こう、行こっか」=“[H名]... Then, let's go over there?”
「またここに来ようね、二人で」=“Let's come here together again, sometime.”
「ああ、絶対にな」=“Yeah, for sure.”
「よし！　そろそろ帰ろうか」=“Alright! Shall we head home?”
「あ、ちょっと待った」=“Ah, wait a bit.”
「どうかした？」=“What's up?”
「せっかくだから、帰りも恋人っぽく行こうぜ」=“Since we're doing lovey-dovey stuff anyway, we might as well walk home like lovers too.”
「そっか、家に帰るまでが恋人だもんな」=“I see, we're still a couple until we get home, after all.”
「帰った後もずっと恋人だろーが。ほら腕、出せよ」=“We'll be a couple even after we get home. Come on, hold out your arm.”
「そんなカツアゲみたいな言い方……」=“Man, you sound like you're shaking me down for lunch money...”
「うるさい！　がっちりしっかり腕組むぞ。恋人だもんな！」=“Shaddup! I'm gonna grab your arm real tight. We're a couple, after all!”
「へへっ、離してやんねーからな！」=“Hehe--, I ain't letting you go!”
