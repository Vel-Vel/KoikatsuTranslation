「えっ？　ここ女子トイレよ？　はい、すぐに出ていこうね」=“Eh? You know this is the women's toilet, yea? Yes, let's leave quickly.”
「……こんな場所にキミがいちゃダメでしょ！？　もしかしてどこかと間違えた？」=“...You know you shouldn't be in this place, right!? Did you confuse this place with somewhere else?”
「あ、今ちょっと忙しいの。ごめんね」=“Ah, I'm a bit busy right now. Sorry.”
「……何か用かしら？」=“... You need something?”
「あー、今時間がないの。ごめん、タイミング悪かったね」=“Ah, I don't have time right now. Sorry, you just caught me at a bad time.”
「すぅ……すぅ……んん……今日も頑張る……」=“Haah... Haah... Mmm... I'll work hard today as well...”
「こらっ！　こんな格好は見ちゃいけません！」=“Hey! You shouldn't go around looking like that!”
「水着姿、結構自信あるんだけど……あはは、やっぱり恥ずかしいね」=“While I do have quite a lot of confidence in showing off a swimsuit... as expected, it's still incredibly embarrassing.”
「ふぅ……ここからの眺めって気持ちいいのよね」=“Fufu... the view here is amazing.”
「廊下は走っちゃダメよ？」=“You shouldn't run in the hallway.”
「しーっ、図書室では静かにしなきゃ……迷惑かけちゃダメよ？」=“Shhh, be quiet in the library... We shouldn't be a nuisance.”
「付いていくのは構わないけど、どこまで行くのかな？」=“I don't mind following you, but where are we going, exactly?”
「ちょっ、どこに入ろうとしてるの！　ダメよっ！」=“Hey, you mustn't go in there!”
「あっ……ふふっ、キミと話せると思うと何だか楽しくなっちゃうな」=“Ah... Fufu... Just thinking about having a chat with you makes me happy.”
「そういえば……キミって男の子なのよね……あ、ううん、深い意味はないわよ」=“Speaking of that... You really are a boy, aren't you?... Ah, no, I didn't mean anything super deep by that.”
「キミも一緒にやってみる？　運動不足の解消になるわよ」=“Wanna try it with me? It'll make up for your lack of exercise.”
「あら……もしかして、うちの部に興味あるの？」=“Oh... Are you perhaps interested in our club?”
「コイカツ部の活動中？　いいねぇ、青春だねぇ！」=“In the middle of Koikatsu Club Activities? That's great, youth is the springtime of life afterall.”
「ふふっ、この時間こそ至福よね」=“Fufu, this time is to be cherished.”
「今日も一日、よく頑張りました！　私から『お疲れ様』の魔法を授けましょう」=“You worked really hard today, didn't you? Then, I'll bestow upon you the magic words, "Thanks for your hard work".”
「ひゃんっ！　キミいたの！？　もー、びっくりするじゃない」=“Hyan! You were here!? You startled me.”
「あら、どうしたの？」=“Oh, what happened?”
「周りから頼られそうなイメージあるけど……大変じゃない？」=“You have an aura of reliableness, isn't it hard?”
「ううん、頼られるのは好きよ？　キミも頼ってくれていいからね」=“Nah, I don't mind being relied upon. It's fine for you to rely on me to, you know”
「うーん、そんなイメージあるかなぁ？　よくサバサバしてるって言われるから、そのせいかしら」=“Well, I wonder if I have that kind of an aura? People do say I'm fairly laid back, maybe it's because of that?”
「やっぱり女子って甘いお菓子が好きなのかな？」=“So girls really do like sweets, huh?”
「ええ、私は好きよ。新製品はついつい買っちゃう」=“Yes, I really like them. I always buy brand new ones without thinking.”
「んー、友達は大体好きかも。私？　私は辛いお菓子が好きな人」=“Mmm, I think my friends like them a lot. Me? I personally like savory snacks a lot more.”
「何だか時々すっごく年上に感じることがあるよ」=“For some reason, from time to time, I feel really old”
「あはは、実はすっごくすっごく年上なのかもよ？　なーんて」=“Ahaha, Don't you mean really, really old? Just kidding.”
「もー、女性に対して失礼じゃないかなぁ？　ま、別に嫌じゃないけど」=“Jeez, saying that to a girl is very rude, you know? Well, it's not like I mind it.”
「うーん……今は何か別の話しましょうか」=“Well... How about we talk about something else today?”
「予習復習って簡単に言うけど……」=“It's easy to make a plan to study but...”
「そうそう、キツいよね。毎日の時間は限られてるっていうのにさー」=“Exactly, it's pretty tough, isn't it? Especially since the time we have to ourselves daily is very limited.”
「この間、街で迷子を見かけたんだけど……」=“The other day, I saw a lost child in the town but...”
「きちんと交番に連れて行ってあげたんだ？　偉い！　私が褒めてあげよう！」=“You took him to the police station properly? Amazing! For that, I'll praise you!”
「学園までの道ってさ、結構ゴミが多くない？」=“Isn't there, like, tons of trash on the side of the road on the way to school?”
「ポイ捨てしてる人がいるんだよ。許せないなぁ」=“There's a lot of people that litter on it, aren't there? Truly unforgivable.”
「合コンとかセッティングしたりする？」=“Wanna set up a mixer or something?”
「一度、頼まれて挑戦はしたんだけど……男友達がいなくて無理だったよ」=“I did give it a try once, but it didn't work out since I had no male friends”
「しないしない。大体、男子の知り合いなんて、キミ以外いないし」=“Nah, I'm good. In the first place, I don't know any guys other than you.”
「勝手なイメージだけど……よく恋愛相談とかされそうだよね」=“It's seems like an unwanted image to have but... people often ask you for love advice, don't they?”
「まぁ、ないことはないけど……的確なアドバイスが出来てるかどうかは謎よ？」=“Well, saying that they don't would be a lie but... who knows if the advice I give out is correct or not.”
「あー、そういうイメージかぁ。でも実はね、一度も相談されたことないの」=“Ah, I do have that kind of image, don't I? But, to be honest, no one has ever asked me for any such advice.”
「好きな男性のタイプってどんな感じ？」=“What kind of a guy is your type, exactly?”
「即答で優しい人。優しければあとは気にしないかな」=“In a word, a kind person. As long as they're kind and gentle, I really don't mind much else.”
「うーん、タイプって言われても……自分に合う人？　かしら？」=“Well, even if you say type... a person that fits me, I guess?”
「こういう話ってちょっと難しいというか、恥ずかしいというか……別の話題にしましょ？」=“Talking about this kind of stuff, it's kinda hard, or rather, embarrassing... Can't we talk about something else?”
「コイバナかぁ……うーん、女子と恋愛のことを話すって難しいなぁ」=“Love talk, huh?... Well, talking with girls about love and stuff is certainly difficult.”
「うんうん、分かるよ。異性だもんね」=“I totally get you. It's the opposite sex afterall.”
「コイカツ部部長としては、恋愛に詳しくないといけないんだよね」=“As the president of the Koikatsu club, I need to be familiar with things related to love, don't I.”
「活動しながら徐々に詳しくなればいいんじゃない？　焦ることないわよ」=“Isn't it fine to become familiar with that kind of stuff while doing club activities over time? There's no need to be impatient.”
「この学園って、女子同士の恋愛とかは……」=“In this school, aren't lesbian couples...”
「わわ、いきなり禁断ゾーンに踏み込んだわね。あるかもしれないしー、ないかもしれないしー……あはは」=“Woah, I suddenly stepped into a forbidden zone, didn't I? Maybe there are, maybe there aren't... Ahaha.”
「積極的な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about proactive guys?”
「いいんじゃない？　ぐいぐい引っ張ってくれる人、好きよ」=“I think they're good. I like guys who can strongly take the lead.”
「積極性を強引と履き違えてたら……嫌ね」=“Just the idea of them being coercive and pushy in the name of being "active"... I don't like it.”
「慎重な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about careful and prudent guys?”
「物事をしっかり考えてくれそうで……安心できるかも」=“They think carefully about everything... I feel like they're reliable... Like I can let my guard down around them.”
「ダメダメ、男の子なら時に大胆に！　時にアグレッシブに！　でしょ？」=“I personally think men have to be bold and daring at times! Like, Aggressive, you get me?”
「勤勉な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about dilligent guys?”
「真面目なのは悪いことじゃないわ。尊敬できるわね」=“It's not a bad thing to be serious and earnest. In my opinion, they're respectable.”
「私がいい加減だからなぁ。あんまり堅苦しいのはちょっと……」=“I'm a bit irresponsible, as you know. Those kinds of people are a bit too stiff for me...”
「マイペースな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of guys who always move at their own pace?”
「周りに流されないのは素敵かも。自分がある！　って感じがするでしょ？」=“The idea of not being caught in the flow of others is wonderful, I think. "I exist!", that kind of feeling, ya know?”
「独りよがりな感じがして苦手ね。空気が読める人の方がいいわ」=“I'm bad with those sorts of people. They're all a bit caught up within themselves, dontcha think? Rather, I prefer guys who can read the mood.”
「優しい男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about kind and gentle guys?”
「すごくいいわね。優しさって、私にとっては最高のアピールポイントなんだけど……みんなは違うのかしら？」=“They're really nice. Kindness is one of my biggest appeal points... is it not the case for everyone?”
「優しいだけじゃ物足りないかな。たまには厳しくして欲しいものね」=“Kindness alone is not enough, in my opinion. I think they should be strict and severe as well, from time to time.”
「クールな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about cool guys?”
「冷静沈着、いいわね。そういう人には憧れるわ」=“Being cool, calm and collected sounds great. I really admire those kinds of people.”
「何だか一人で生きていけそうなイメージ。恋愛対象としては難しいかも」=“They feel like the types that prefer living alone, to me. I think it would be hard for me to think of them as potential love interests.”
「この年頃ってみんなエッチなことに興味あるのかな？」=“At this age, I wonder if everyone is interested in lewd acts”
「おー、さすが男の子。キミはそういうことに興味があるんだね？　ん？　ん？」=“Ah, Truly a boy. So you have an interest in those sorts of things? Hmm? Hmm?”
「ここだけの話、私は無きにしも非ずだけど……みんなはどうかしらね」=“Just between you and me, I do have a certain amount of interest but... I wonder about everyone else myself.”
「エッチの時ってやっぱり男がリードするべきなのかな？」=“I wonder if guys should take the lead after all, when it comes to sex?”
「そうねぇ、やっぱりそれが普通なんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで私の意見よ？」=“I think that it is normal for them to do so, yea. Although, that is just my opinion.”
「女子でもぐいぐい行く娘はいるんじゃない？　好みの問題は別として」=“I'm sure there are girls who get into the mood quite a bit. Ah, but tastes depend on the person.”
「エッチな本とか読んだことある？」=“Have you read any porn magazines or the like?”
「まぁ、多少はね……クラスで回し読みとかするし……あ、でもソフトな方だと思うわよ？」=“Well, more or less... They're frequently passed around the class... Tho I think they were pretty softcore.”
「興味ないわけじゃないけど、あんまり機会がないかなぁ。でもキミ、女子にそんなこと聞いちゃうわけ？」=“It's not like I'm not interested in them, but I haven't gotten a chance to actually go through one. But, why are you asking girls that sorts of questions anyway?”
「こういうのってもっと仲良くなってから話すこと……よね？」=“This kind of thing, shouldn't we get to know each other better first?”
「この間観た洋画がさ、すごいベッドシーンで……」=“The other day I saw this western movie, and it had this amazing bed scene...”
「え、それ何て洋画？　私も観てみようかしら……なんちゃって」=“Eh? What movie was that? Maybe I'll try watching it... Just kidding.”
「エッチの時って……どうして女の子は声が出ちゃうのかな」=“When having sex... why do girls let out squeals like that?”
「いや、もうそれ完全にセクハラ発言だし……知ってても答えないわよ？」=“Hey, isn't that straight up sexual harrassment?... Even if I knew why, I wouldn't tell you.”
「あのね、この間、近所の猫がすっごい交尾してて……」=“You know, the other day, the neighbourhood cat was really good at it with another cat...”
「あははっ、もーっ、それで笑っちゃったら、私が下ネタ好きみたいになるじゃないー」=“Ahaha, Jeez~, Don't make me laugh at stuff like that. If someone saw me, they'll think I'm a dirty girl who loves dirty jokes.”
「私ってそんなにサバサバしてるように見えるかしら？」=“Do I really seem that easy-going and laid-back?”
「そっかぁ。やっぱりそういう風に見られちゃうのね。まぁ、間違ってはないけど、ふふっ」=“I see. So that's what I seem like to others afterall. Well, it's not like it's incorrect. Fufu.”
「おお、キミはそういう風に見てくれるんだ。男子からの意見は貴重だね」=“Ooh, So that's how you see me. A boy's opinion is pretty valuable to me.”
「自分で考えるイメージと違うのかしら……？」=“I wonder if it's different from the image I try to maintain.”
「ねぇ、キミは動物とか好きな方かな？」=“Hey, are you the type of person who likes animals?”
「ふふっ、私も動物には目がないの。ほ乳類、爬虫類、魚類、なんでも好きよ」=“Fufu, I'm a sucker for animals too. No matter what kind. Whether reptiles, mammals or fishes, I like them all.”
「それじゃあ一緒だね。私も……ちょっと苦手……あはは」=“In that case we're the same. I'm... pretty bad with animals too... Ahaha...”
「キミって男の子だし、やっぱりたくさん食べるのかしら？」=“You're a guy, I wonder if you eat tons of food afterall.”
「ふふっ、私も同じよ。すっごく食べる方だから友達に驚かれちゃうの」=“Fufu. I'm the same way. I'm the type to eat tons of food. I always surprise my friends with how much I can eat.”
「そうなの？　なんだか意外ね。私もね、こう見えて小食なのよ？　あ、本当だってばー」=“Really? That's kinda unexpected. I'm the same way. Even if I look like this, I have a pretty small appetite. Really, I'm being serious~”
「キミって……なにげにお料理とか上手そうよね。よく作ったりするの？」=“I don't know why... but you look like you're good at cooking to me. Do you cook often?”
「私もお料理好きよ。今度一緒に何か作ってみない？」=“I love cooking too. Wanna try cooking something together sometime?”
「あらら、違った？　大丈夫、お料理なんて出来なくても平気よ。って、私もあんまり出来ないから人のこと言えないんだけど♪」=“Oh my, was I wrong? Ah, it's fine though, even if you can't cook, it's fine. Eh, it's not like I can cook super well either, so why am I going around passing judgement?”
「キミ、身体を動かすのって好き？　体育の授業とか……」=“Hey, do you like moving your body? Like during P.E class or whatever...”
「そうなんだ。こう見えて私も好きなのよ。結構得意なんだから」=“I see. I may look like this but I love it too. I'd go so far as to call it my speciality.”
「やっぱりそういうタイプかー。ううん、大丈夫、私も苦手だもの」=“Ah, so you're that sort of person afterall. Nah, It's fine. It's not my cup of tea either.”
「ね、キミは日頃から真面目に勉強するタイプ？」=“Hey, are you the kind of person to study hard everyday from morning to evening?”
「ふふっ、偉い偉い！　私もコツコツ派だから気が合うかもね」=“Fufu, that's great! I'm also in the same "study hard" camp, so we might get along.”
「そうよねー。しなきゃいけないとは思いつつ……私も……ふふっ」=“I feel that. Only studying because we must. I am the same way... Fufu.”
「キミはおしゃれに気を遣ってるのかしら？」=“Do you go out of your way to try to be fashionable?”
「あら、さすがね。私も暇さえあれば洋服見ちゃう。見てるだけでも楽しいのよ」=“Oh, you too huh? Whenever I have free time, I go out window shopping for trendy clothes as well. Just looking at them is fun.”
「無頓着なのね。実は私も……わりと気にしないの。幻滅しちゃった？」=“Ah, you don't care, huh? Actually, I'm the same way... I don't particularly care that much either. Ya disappointed?”
「そっか、私とは違うのね」=“I see, we're different in that way I suppose.”
「ねぇ、男の子だったら女子が言って欲しい言葉くらい、分からない？」=“Hey, since you're a guy, don't you know what words a girl wants to hear the most?”
「あ……ふふっ、私こそ大人げなかったわね、ごめんなさい。仲直り……してくれる？」=“Ah, Fufu, I was being immature, I'm sorry. Will you make up... with me?”
「謝ったって、そう簡単には許してあげないんだから。こう見えて結構怒ってるのよ？」=“An apology isn't enough. There's no way I'll forgive you that easily. I'm actually pretty angry, you know?”
「うーん……私の顔、どこか変なところでもある？」=“Well... Is there something weird on my face?”
「もー、気になっちゃうでしょ。あんまりジロジロ見ちゃダメよ？」=“Don't stare at my face so much. I'm curious what you're looking at so hard.”
「ダメだってば。さすがに怒るわよ？」=“I said it's no good. I'll actually get mad.”
「……んー、どこ見てるのかな？　ん？　ん？」=“...Hmmmm... where do you think you're looking at? Hmm? Hmm?”
「そういうとこ、じーっと見るの良くないと思うなぁ。本気よ？」=“I don't think it's good for you to stare at that kind of place so intently. I'm being serious.”
「キミがセクハラ男子になるのを見過ごすわけにはいかないわね。はい、もう禁止！」=“Nope, I can't overlook this sexual harrassment anymore. Here, Stop!”
「……ジロジロ見たって何も変わらないよ」=“...staring at it so intently won't actually make it change or anything, you know.”
「えっ……いきなりどうしたの？　私の手、何か気になる？」=“Eh... What's this all of a sudden? Why the sudden interest in my hand?”
「やんっ……もー、男子に手を握られるのって結構緊張するのよ？」=“Hiya!... Jeez~, you know it's very nervewracking to have your hand suddenly grasped by a guy.”
「そんなに触っちゃダメ。あんまりやりすぎると気持ち悪いって思っちゃうわよ？」=“You shouldn't go around touching girls like that. If you overdo it, I'll feel disgusted, you know?”
「ひゃんっ！　う、うそっ……わざとじゃない……わよね？」=“Hyan! Unbelievable... That wasn't on purpose... was it?”
「わざと触ってるの！？　こ、こんなことしちゃダメ……って、教えてあげなきゃ分からない？」=“It was on purpose!? You can't do things like this... Why do I even have to tell you stuff like this?”
「もう、分かっててやってるなら質が悪いよ？　いい？　こういうことはいけないことなの！」=“Jeez, doing it even when you know better makes you seem really nasty, you know? Get it? You can't go around doing things like this!”
「あら……頭、何かついてた？」=“Hmm...? Was there something on my head?”
「もう……誰にでも簡単にそういうことしちゃダメ。意外と特別なことなのよ？」=“Jeez... you can't go around doing stuff like that to everyone so easily, it's actually a very special thing to do, you know?”
「お互いに誤解されたら困るでしょ？　だからここまで！　ね？」=“A misunderstanding about something like this will trouble us both, no? So, stop here! Alright?”
「こ、こらっ、いきなりなんてことするのっ！？」=“H-Hey!, What do you think you're doing all of a sudden?”
「人のほっぺた触って喜ぶなんて悪趣味すぎるわよ、もう」=“Being that happy while touching someone's cheek is in bad taste, you know?”
「うーん、さすがの私もイライラしちゃいそうな空気……本気よ？」=“Uhm, Even someone like me will get irritated if you keep this up... I'm being serious.”
「……何を考えてるの？」=“...What are you thinking?”
「ちょっとずつキミとの距離が縮まってる気がするわね。私の勘違い……じゃないといいんだけど♪」=“I feel like the distance between us is slowly decreasing. I hope I'm not the only one who feels this way... ♪”
「男子との会話って新鮮ね」=“Having a conversation like this with a boy feels so refreshing.”
「うーん、何か楽しい話はないかしら……」=“Well, can't we talk about something fun...”
「キミって……聞きたい言葉も言ってくれずに放っておくのね」=“You... You're just going to leave without saying the words I want to hear, aren't you?”
「……ごめんなさい、もうやめましょう。なんだかイメージと違う会話になっちゃったわね」=“...I'm sorry, let's stop here. Somehow this conversation turned out different from what I was expecting.”
「こういう状態で会話しても楽しくないわよね」=“It's not fun to have a chat in a situation like this.”
「キミと話してるとすごく楽しいわ。また色々話しましょ」=“When I'm talking with you, I always have an absolute blast. Let's talk about tons of different things again, alright?”
「キミの話聞いてると……私、興味津々になっちゃう。何にって……それは秘密よ♪」=“Whenever you tell me something new... I always become super interested in it. Hmm? Interested in which part, exactly? That's a secret ♪”
「今回はここまでにしましょ。またね」=“Let's stop here for now. See ya later.”
「ええ、それじゃこれで。キミさえ良ければ、また声かけてね」=“Yes, then let's stop here for now. If it's good with you, call me out for a chat again, alright?”
「ふふっ、またね」=“Fufu, see ya later~”
「よかったら一緒に帰らない？」=“If it's alright with you, wanna walk home together?”
「ええ、いいわよ。ちょうど予定もなかったの」=“Yeah, alright. I don't have anything I need to do either.”
「ごめんね、今日はちょっと用事があって……また今度誘ってね」=“Ah, sorry about this, I have plans already... Invite me out again next time, alright?”
「よかったら一緒に勉強しない？」=“If you like, wanna study together?”
「ええ、やりましょ。一人でやるより二人の方が捗るものね」=“Alright, let's do it. Two heads are better than one, as they say.”
「あ……今は無理なの、ごめんね。でも勉強はしたいから、機会があれば一緒にしましょ」=“Ah... Sorry, I can't do it right now, really sorry. But it's not that I don't wanna do it. If I get a chance, let's study together.”
「一緒に身体を動かさない？」=“Wanna do exercise together?”
「ふふっ、奇遇ね。私も身体動かしたいなって思ってたところよ」=“Fufu, what a coincidence. I was just thinking about getting some exercise myself.”
「今はそういう気分じゃないかな。せっかく誘ってくれたのに、ごめんね」=“Ah, I'm not in the mood for something like that right now. Sorry about this, you went out of your way to invite me and everything.”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらっていい？」=“Can you come with me for a sec?”
「ふふっ、どうしたの？」=“Fufu, what's up?”
「ごめん、今は無理なの。ちょっとタイミング悪かったかな」=“Ah, sorry, I can't right now. I'm a bit busy.”
「ちょ、ちょっとなに普通に入ってきてるの？　誰かに見つかったら大問題よ？」=“H-Hey, what are you doing entering this place so casually? If someone finds you, it'll be a big problem, you know?”
「きゃーっ！　いくら男子トイレが少ないからって、ここは使っちゃダメよ！」=“Kyaa! You can't enter this place! No matter if the men's toilets are not enough, you simply cannot enter this place!”
「も、もー、私しかいなかったからいいものの……キミ、変なところで度胸あるのね」=“J-Jeez, It's fine since there wasn't anyone but me who could do this but... You sure have tons for courage for the weirdest things...”
「きゃっ！　こんなとこで何してるの！？　って、くつろいでないで早く出なきゃダメよ！」=“Kyaa! What are you doing in this place!? Huh? Stop hanging about like it's your home and leave already!”
「あ、キミか……ふんだ」=“Ah, It's you... Hmph”
「なんなの？」=“What is it?”
「あっ、ごめんね、今はちょっと忙しくて……また今度、ね？」=“Ah, Sorry, I'm a bit busy today... Maybe next time, alright?”
「ひゃあぁっ！　こんな姿見られたっ！　お嫁に行けなくなったら、キミが責任取ってくれるの？　なんちゃって」=“Hyaaa! To be seen like this! If I can't become a bride anymore, will you take responsibility? Just kidding.”
「こ、こらっ！　いくら興味があってもそんなにジロジロ見ちゃダメよ！」=“H-Hey! No matter how interested you might be, staring so intently is bad, you know!”
「別に見られるのは嫌じゃないけど……やっぱり恥ずかしいわよね」=“While I don't particularly hate being seen like this... Nonetheless, it is very embarrassing.”
「こういう姿を堂々と見るのもスゴイと思うなぁ、お姉さんは」=“Onee-san don't know whether to be shocked or amazed at how brazenly you're just staring at her...”
「ここに来ると、空って広いなぁって感動するのよねー」=“Whenever I come here, I'm always moved by how wide the sky is here.”
「うちの学園、廊下もぴかぴかでしょ？　女子校だから掃除も徹底してるのよ」=“Isn't the hallway in our institute always spotless? Since it's an all-girls school, even the cleaning is always done thouroughly.”
「あ……キミも何か借りるの？　オススメの本とか教えてあげよっか？」=“Ah... Are you also going to borrow a book? Want recommendations?”
「きちんと付いてきてるわよ」=“I'm right behind you.”
「ちょっと、ちょっと！　どこに入ろうとしてるのっ」=“Hey, Wait! Where do you think you're entering?”
「ふふっ、今度のデート、すっごく楽しみにしてるからね。お姉さん、期待してるんだから」=“Fufu, I'm really looking forward to our next date. Don't let down this onee-san's expectations~”
「時々ね、キミのことすごいなぁって思うよ。尊敬しちゃう」=“Sometimes, I can't help but think how amazing you are. I really respect you.”
「うーん、キミを見てると男女の身体の違いが気になってきちゃうなぁ。あ、え、エッチな話じゃないよ？」=“Well, When I look at you, I can't help but notice how different a man's body is compared to ours. Ah, I wasn't talking about anything l-lewd, ok?”
「おー、まさか応援に来てくれたの？　頑張るよー！」=“Oh, have you come to cheer me on? I'll work hard--!”
「あら、うちの部に興味持ってくれてるのかしら？　体験してみる？」=“Oh? Interested in our club? Wanna try a hands-on exercise?”
「部活に励んでるのねぇ、感心感心！」=“Working hard at club activities, huh? Truly praiseworthy!”
「ふぅ、これでようやく一息ね。まぁ、午後は睡魔との戦いだけど」=“Fuu, finally a breather. I'll be fighting sleepiness in the afternoon tho.”
「んー、この解放感。毎日の楽しみね」=“Nnmm, this sense of freedom, one of the few things I can look forward to everyday.”
「きゃんっ！　キミっ、いたの！？　へ、変な声聞かないでよ、もー」=“Kyaa! You, you were there!? Don't surprise me like that! I even let out such a weird noise, jeez.”
「なになに？　お姉さんに用かな？」=“What is it? You need something from this onee-san?”
「時々、お姉ちゃんっぽいって言われない？」=“Do people often tell you that you feel like an onee-chan at times?”
「うんうん、よく言われるわよ。キミもそう感じるなら、これからは私のこと、お姉ちゃんだと思ってみる？」=“Yep, I get told that very often. If you feel the same way, you can think of me as your onee-chan as well.”
「自分ではそう思われたいんだけど……意外と年下扱いされちゃったりするのよね……」=“I do feel the same way but... wouldn't it be weird, considering our age difference is almost nil?”
「ニュース番組とかよく見る？」=“Do you often watch the news?”
「実は毎日チェックしてるの。ほら、私って大人でしょ？」=“I actually check the news daily. Aren't I mature?”
「うーん、あんまり見ないかなぁ。夜はドラマ観てることが多いの」=“Well, I don't check it that much to be honest. I mostly watch dramas on TV when I'm free.”
「この学園に入る前、共学に行こうって思わなかった？」=“Before you joined this school, did you ever think about being in a co-ed school?”
「一度は考えたわよ。でも……やっぱりこの学園がいいなって思ったの」=“I did think about it once, but... in the end, I've always liked being in this school.”
「ううん、考えたことないわね。私の雰囲気的にも女子校の方があってるでしょ？」=“Nope. Not once. Always felt like I belonged only in an all-girls school. Don't you think I have that kind of an aura?”
「家事とかは得意？」=“Are you good at housework?”
「見ての通り、一通りはこなせるわよ。こう見えて私、出来る女なんですからね」=“As you can see, in general, I can do most of everything. I may look like this, but I'm a capable woman.”
「あ、あはは……あはははー……ノーコメントよ！」=“A-Ahaha... Ahahahaha--... No comment!”
「うーん、せっかくだからキミとは違うお話がしたいわね」=“Well, we don't get to talk often so I really wanna talk about something else with you.”
「この間の大雨の日、駅前の排水溝が……」=“The other day, when it raining super heavily, the drain in front of the station...”
「知ってる知ってる。噴水みたいになること、あるわよね」=“Oh, I know about this. It became like a water fountain, didn't it?”
「やっぱり彼氏とか欲しい？」=“So you want a boyfriend afterall?”
「まぁ、そういうお年頃だしね。なに？　キミが立候補してくれたりするの？」=“Well, I am about that age after-all. Why, you gonna announce your candidacy for it?”
「うーん、はっきりイエスと答える自信はないわね。今は勉強も大変だし……」=“Well, I don't have the confidence to reply with a solid "yes". Not to mention we're really busy with our studies as it is...”
「キスは相手からして欲しい？」=“Would you prefer your partner to initiate kisses?”
「そうね。ちょっと強引に……って、なに恥ずかしいこと言わせてるのよー」=“Yeah, for sure. Hopefully they're a bit pushy about it... Eh, what kind of embarrassing things are you even making me say--”
「たまには私からしたい……かな。なーんて。あ、こら、変な目で見ないの！」=“Sometimes I wanna be the one who initiates them... Yeah. Ah, hey, Don't look at me with those fishy eyes!”
「結婚するとしたら、式って挙げたい？」=“If you ever get married, would you prefer a full blown ceremony?”
「もちろん。私だって女の子ですからね。一生に一度くらいウエディングドレスを着てみたいわ」=“Of course. I'm a girl afterall. I wanna try on a wedding dress atleast once in my life.”
「うーん、恥ずかしいから別に……あ、でもドレスは着たいから写真だけは撮りたいかな」=“Well, it's rather embarrassing so not particularly... Ah, but, I do want to take a picture in a wedding dress if possible.”
「好きな人には積極的にアタックする？」=“Would you be proactive in your attempts to court your lover?”
「もちろん！　当たって砕けろが信条！　と言いたいところだけど……そう簡単にはいかないわよね」=“Of course! Make them crumble and fall into your hands, that is my creed!-- Or so I'd like to say but... easier said then done.”
「しないわよー。もー、私のこと、どんな人だと思ってるの？　心はすっごく乙女なんですからね」=“Of course not. What kind of person do you take me for? I'm actually a pure hearted maiden, you know.”
「待って待って。こういう話はまた別の機会にしましょ」=“Wait, Wait. Let's talk about stuff like this another time.”
「この間、街を歩いてたら痴話喧嘩を見かけて……」=“The other day, I was walking around town and saw a couple having a lover's quarrel...”
「あはは……きっと喧嘩するほど仲が良い、って奴だよ」=“Ahaha... They must have been real close, to quarrel like that.”
「日頃からエッチなこととか考える？」=“Have you been thinking about doing lewd things the whole day?”
「素直に言えばそうだけど……その質問をしたキミがすごいって思うわ」=“Well, to be honest, yeah, but... I can't help but be amazed that you have what it takes to ask those sorts of things...”
「考えません！　……本当。本当よ！？」=“Not at all!... Really. I'm telling the truth!”
「エッチってさ、男女でするだけじゃないって知ってる？」=“About sex, you know that it's not a thing only a man and a woman can do, yea?”
「え？　同性とってこと？　……まあ、知ってるわよ。ここ、女子校だし……」=“Eh? You're talking about the same-sex? Well, Yeah, Of course I know that. This is an all-girls highschool, you know...”
「し、知らない知らない。一人でもするなんて知らないんだから！」=“N-Nope, I don't know of it. Not at all. I also don't know that you can do it by yourself, just so you know!”
「憧れのエッチとかある？」=“Is there any particular type of sex you long for?”
「ふふっ、あるわよ。昔観た映画でね、車の中で激しく……って、素敵だなって思っただけよ？」=“Fufu, there is. A long time ago, I saw a scene in a movie, specifically, it showed really rough sex inside a car... Uhm, I just thought it was pretty nice, that's all.”
「特にないわね……そういうシーンを観ても自分に置きかえて考えられないもの」=“Not particularly, no... Even if I saw such a scene in a movie, I don't think I could imagine myself in the same position”
「エッチな夢とか見ちゃう？」=“Do you have wet dreams?”
「うぅ……たまにあるのよね……顔は分からないんだけど、すごく好きな人に抱き締められる幸せな夢」=“Uuu... Sometimes... Although I can't tell who it is from the face, they're always happy dreams about me being hugged by the person I love the most.”
「多分ないと思うわ。起きたら忘れてるんですもの」=“Don't think I do. Even if I did, I always forget my dreams when I wake up anyway.”
「こんな話……いくらキミでもオープンすぎるわ。だからＮＧです」=“This kind of talk... Even if it's you, this kind of thing is too personal for me to tell you, so I can't.”
「耳年増な女の子って、どこで知識を得てくるんだろう」=“All these girls who consider themselves experts in the lewd arts, I wonder where they get all their information?”
「えっと……やっぱりネットじゃない？　いや、私は耳年増じゃないけどね？」=“Uhm... Probably the internet, no? Not to say that I am like those girls though, okay?”
「私、こんなに仲良くなった男の子って初めてかも。キミはどうかしら？」=“I think this is the first time I've ever been this close with a boy. What about you?”
「もー、嘘って分かってても嬉しいなぁ。これからも仲良くしましょうね」=“Jeez, even tho I know it's a lie, it makes me so happy to hear that... Let's get along even more from now own, alright?”
「まぁ、そうよねー。キミは女子のお友達多そうだもの」=“Well, makes sense I guess. You seem to have a lot of female friends after all.”
「キミ、コーヒーはブラックが好き？」=“Hey, do you like your coffee black?”
「やっぱりー。私も一緒。混じりけがないのがいいわよね」=“As I thought. I'm the same way. Coffee with nothing to taint it is the best, isnt it?”
「良かったー。お姉さんもブラック苦手……ミルクないときついのよね」=“I'm glad. This onee-san can't handle black coffee either... It's hard to drink it without atleast milk.”
「お料理って、辛い物は好き？」=“Do you like your food spicy?”
「いいわね！　オススメのアジア料理屋さんあるから、今度一緒に行きましょう」=“Awesome! There's some nice asian restaurants that I know of, next time, let's go together, alright?”
「えへへ、実はお姉さんも無理ー。我慢して食べるのもつらいものね」=“Ehehe... Actually, this onee-san can't handle it either. Even just enduring it is hard.”
「気になってたんだけど、キミは甘い物好き？　ほら、男の子だし、どうかなって」=“I was curious, do you have a sweet tooth? Since you're a guy and all, I was wondering.”
「なるほど、男の子でも甘い物好きはいるのね。私？　私はもちろん大好きよ」=“I see. So there are boys out there who like sweet food as well. Me? Of course, I love sweet food.”
「やっぱり？　男の子ってそういう子多いのかな？　私も苦手なんだけど、女子だと珍しい方なのよ」=“Is that so? I wonder if there are many guys like that? It's not my cup of tea either, although that's a fairly rare quality amongst girls.”
「あのね、参考までに聞かせて欲しいんだけど……理想のバストサイズって聞かせてくれる？」=“Hey, Uhm, This is just for reference but... Can you tell me your ideal bust size?”
「おお、それじゃ私も……って、なにジロジロ見てるの！　そういう意味で聞いたわけじゃないのよ」=“Oooh, then my bust size is... eh, what do you think you're staring at! That's not why I asked!”
「ふふっ、そうよね。何事も普通が一番。うん、そうに決まってるのよ」=“Fufu, that's right. No matter what, normal is the best. Yeah, that makes sense.”
「うそ……本気で言ってくれてるの？　お姉さん感動しちゃうわよ？」=“No way... For real? Are you really saying that? You're not just playing with Onee-san's feelings?”
「キミは女の子に対して好みの身長とかってある？　どれくらいの娘が好き？」=“Do you have any height preference or the like when it comes to girls? If so, how tall do you like them?”
「あら嬉しい。背が高いのって、実はちょっとコンプレックスだったりしたのよ」=“Oh, that makes me happy. You know, I actually have a bit of a complex when it comes to my height.”
「なるほどなるほど。私くらいでちょうどいいかしら？」=“I see, I see. So, about my height then?”
「ふふふっ、今、生まれて初めて、身長低くて良かったって思っちゃったわ」=“Fufufu, for the first time in my life, I'm glad that I'm short.”
「女子に対して、体型の好みとか……もちろんあるわよね？　聞いてもいい？」=“When it comes to girls, you probably have a preferred figure or body type or something... right? Can you tell me about it?”
「本当？　私くらいでも大丈夫？　もー、キミって優しいんだからー」=“Really? Am I good in that regard then? Jeez, it's because you're so kind...”
「ふふっ、体型の維持って大変なんだけど……せっかくだから頑張っちゃおうかしら」=“Fufu, it's really difficult to maintain your body but... well, I suppose I should try my best.”
「ふふっ、嬉しいこと言ってくれるなぁ。こう見えて私、細すぎるかもって気にしてたのよ」=“Fufu, you say some really nice things sometimes. It may not seem like it, but I was really worried that I was too thin”
「そっか……私とは違うタイプね」=“I see... Different from me, huh?”
「お話をしたいのなら、まず最初に言わなきゃいけない言葉があるでしょう？」=“If you wanna talk with me, isn't there something you have to say to me first?”
「ふふっ、私こそごめんなさい。もう怒ってない。だから……そんな顔しないの、ほら、男の子でしょ？」=“Fufu, I'm sorry too. I'm not angry anymore. That's why... Don't make that kind of face. You're a man, aren't you?”
「そうやって適当に謝れば許してもらえると思ってるんでしょう」=“Do you really think I'll forgive you if you make such a half-baked apology?”
「そんなに見つめてどうしたの？　何か気になる？」=“You're staring at me so much, what's up? Curious about something?”
「うーん、男の子の考えることって難しいわね……なにかしら……」=“Hmm, the things that go through a boy's mind are hard to comprehend... for some reason”
「も、もー、分かったわ、私の負け！　恥ずかしいからもう見ないで？　ね？」=“J-Jeez~, I get it, I lose! I get it so stop staring so much, it's embarrassing, please?”
「あ……キミ今……ふふっ、何でもない。それとも言ってあげた方がキミのためかしら？」=“Ah... Just now, You... Fufu, it's nothing. Or would it be better if I said it out loud, for your sake?”
「だから気付いてるってば。そういうところは見ちゃダメよ、もう」=“That's why I'm conscious of it! Don't stare at that place so much, Jeez!”
「キミ、わざとジロジロ見てるでしょう。いい加減にしないと、お姉さん怒っちゃうんだからね」=“You're staring at it so intently on purpose, aren't you? If you don't cut it out, onee-san will get mad, you know?”
「ジロジロ観察する前にやることがあるんじゃないかしら？」=“Isn't there something you should do before staring at me like that?”
「きゃっ……ど、どうしたの？　何か付いてた？」=“Kyaa... W-What's up? Did something happen?”
「あんまり気軽に触らないの。女子はデリケートなのよ？」=“Don't go around casually touching girls, okay? Girls are very delicate, you know?”
「もー、ダメって言ってるでしょう。手を触られるだけで色々考えちゃうんだから！」=“Jeez, I'm telling you it's no good. Just having my hand touched like that makes me thing of all kinds of stuff!”
「ひゃんっ！　え……な、なに、今何したの？　わざと……じゃないわよね？」=“Hyan! Eh... W-What, What did you do just now? It... It wasn't on purpose, right?”
「ひゃぁっ！　わざと触ったの！？　あ、有り得ないと思うんだけど……」=“Hyan! It was on purpose!? It can't be...”
「はぅっ、さすがにもう触らせないわよ。セクハラなんだからね」=“Hauu, I can't let you touch me anymore. This is clearly sexual harassment.”
「あら……何かしら？　突然なでなでしたくなったの？」=“Oh... What is it? Sudden craving for patting someone's head?”
「むぅ……何だか小さな子みたいな扱い……私のキャラに合わないなぁ」=“Muuu... Treating me like a small child... I don't think it fits my character.”
「恥ずかしいからここまで！　さすがに照れちゃうわ」=“Since it's embarrassing, this is as far as I'll let you go! Any more and I'll become really shy and bashful.”
「ひゃんっ……むぅ、今、柔らかいとか思ったでしょう？」=“Hyan~... Muu, Just now, you were thinking that I was really soft and tender, weren't you?”
「柔らかさを確認しなくていいの！　そんなに強く触ったら跡ついちゃう！」=“You don't have to personally confirm that it's soft! If you feel it up with so much strength, it'll leave marks!”
「こーらー、お姉さんをバカにしてると怖い目に遭わせちゃうわよー！」=“Look here, If you make fun of this onee-san, you'll find yourself having an encounter with a pair of scary eyes!”
「キミはもっと空気を読むべきだと思うわ」=“I think you ought to learn to read the mood a bit more.”
「キミと話してると何でも新鮮。わくわくしちゃうなぁ」=“If I'm talking with you, any old topic seems fresh. It makes me really excited.”
「男の子との会話って楽しいのね。ふふっ」=“Talking with a boy sure is fun. Fufu”
「誰かとおしゃべりするのってストレス解消にもなるのよ。キミも楽しんでくれてるかしら？」=“Chatting with someone sure works wonders for stress relief. Are you also having fun?”
「あら、難しい顔してどうしたのかしら？　何か楽しいお話を考えてくれてるの？」=“Oh dear, what's with that serious face? Did something happen? Are you thinking of fun conversations to have?”
「こういう時に黙っちゃうなんて……はぁぁ」=“At times like these I should just be silent... Haa”
「今の私、ちょっとイライラしちゃってる。何でだか……分かるわよね？」=“Right now, I'm a bit frustrated. Not sure why... Do you get it?”
「もう……全然すっきりしない。じゃあね」=“Tsk... I can't seem to calm down. See ya later.”
「今度またキミとお話出来るのが楽しみよ。色々なこと、聞かせてね」=“I'm looking forward to having another chat with you later. Tell me about lots of things, alright?”
「健全なお話も楽しいけど……次回はもう少しドキドキするお話でも……なーんて。ふふっ、それじゃまたね」=“Wholesome conversation is fun but... let's have a more heart-throbbing conversation maybe next time... just an idle thought. Fufu, then, I'll see you later~”
「楽しい時間をありがとう。またお話しましょうね」=“Thanks for the fun times. Let's talk again sometime.”
「ええ、またいつでも声を掛けて。楽しみに待ってるわね」=“Yes, call for me again at any time. I'll be looking forward to it.”
「ええ、またね」=“Yes, see you later.”
「俺、[H名]のことが好きなんだ」=“I really like you, [H名].”
「ありがとう。でも……ごめんなさい。今はまだそういうことは考えられないの」=“Thank you. But, I'm sorry. Right now, I still can't bring myself to think about that stuff.”
「ふふっ、嬉しい……私も自分の気持ちに向き合って気づいたの。キミが好きよ」=“Fufu, I'm happy... I've also noticed my own feelings for you. I really like you too.”
「ごめんなさい。私……自分の気持ちが分からなくて……安易には決められないわ」=“I'm sorry. I... still haven't sorted out my feelings. I can't do it so quickly and carelessly.”
「……わ、私っ、キミのことが好きっ……だからそのっ……もしよかったら付き合ってくれない……かな？」=“...I-I... I really like you as well... That's why... If you'd like... won't you go out with me?”
「あ……ありがとう！　すっごく嬉しいっ！　ふふっ、安心したら力抜けちゃった……」=“T-Thanks! I'm so happy! Fufu, as soon as I relaxed, all my power left me...”
「あ……ううん、気にしないで。私は思いを伝えられただけでも満足……だから……」=“Ah... Don't worry about it. I'm happy just being able to convey my feelings to you... that's why...”
「……繰り返しでごめん。私、キミのこと諦められないの。もう一度、お付き合いのこと、考えてくれないかな？」=“... I'm sorry to bring it up again. I just can't bring myself to give up on you. Can't you think about our relationship once again?”
「え……ほ、本当？　あ……ふふっ、ありがとうっ！　こんなに嬉しいことってないわ！」=“Eh... R-Really? Ah... Fufu, Thank you! There isn't anything that could make me happier!”
「平気よ。分かってたことだから……でも……これからもキミのこと、好きでいさせて」=“It's fine. I understand, so it's fine... but... let me continue liking you.”
「あ、あのさ、[H名]とHしたいなって」=“I-I was thinking, I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「え？　冗談でしょ？　うそ、本気……なの？　ごめんなさい、さすがにそれは抵抗あるわね……」=“Eh? Surely that's a joke? No way, are you... serious? I'm sorry. That is a bit...”
「[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「もう……キミ、押せば何とかなるって思ってるでしょう？　まぁ、実際負けちゃうんだけど……ふふっ、いいわ、しましょ？」=“Jeez... You really think I'll agree to it if you keep at it for long enough? Well, you're not wrong... Fufu, Alright. Let's do it.”
「そういうのは無理よ。身体だけじゃなくて気持ちの問題もあるし……」=“I'm sorry, I just can't. It's not just a matter of the body but feelings as well...”
「ここで[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名].”
「人……いるわよ？　本気？　だったら……付き合うけど♪　そういうプレイ……私も興味あるもの」=“There are... people... here. You really want to do it here? Then, I'll go along with you ♪ This kind of fetish play... I've also been interested in it.”
「エッチっていうのは、人がいないところでするものよ？　秘め事っていうでしょう？」=“Isn't sex something you have in a place devoid of people? A secret act?”
「うそ、こんなところで？　でも……ふふっ、たまにはそういうスリルもいいかもね」=“No way, In a place like this? But... Fufu, sometimes fetish play like this is also fine I suppose.”
「ここでなんてダメよ。もう、勢い任せなんだから」=“A place like this is no good. Jeez, I'll leave it to you, I suppose.”
「あ、あのねっ……実は私、すっごくエッチに興味があるの！　だから……その……して……くれないかな？」=“Ah, well, look... In all honesty, I'm actually really interested in sex! That's why... that' is... won't you... do it with me?”
「ありがとう。変な娘だって思われるかもしれないけど……こんなこと、キミにしか頼めなくて……」=“Thank you. I don't know if you think of me as a strange girl because of it but... something like this, there's no one I could ask except you...”
「わわっ、そ、そうよね！　ごめんなさい。私、ちょっとどうかしてたみたい……お願い、忘れて？」=“Y-You're right! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me... Please, can you just forget about it?”
「これからお昼、一緒にどうかな？」=“How about we spend the lunch break together after this?”
「ええ、いいわよ。私もキミに声掛けようと思ってたところなの」=“Okay, Alright. I was just thinking of calling you out myself.”
「ごめんなさい。今日はちょっと忙しくてあまり時間がないの。また今度誘ってね」=“I'm really sorry. I'm a bit busy today, so I have no time. Invite me out again sometime, alright?”
「今日のお昼は先約がいるかしら？　もしフリーなら一緒にどう？」=“Do you have plans with anyone for the lunch break today? If you're free, wanna spend it together?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。キミと一緒なら楽しいお昼が過ごせるの」=“Fufu, Thank you. With you, I can pass the lunch break while having fun.”
「あら、残念……それじゃまた誘うわね」=“Oh, that's too bad... Then I'll invite you again some other time.”
「俺と一緒にコイカツしない？」=“Wanna do love activities with me?”
「ふふっ、待ってたわ。それじゃどんなことをしましょうか？」=“Fufu, I was waiting for that. Then, what shall we do?”
「あ……ごめんなさい、今日は無理なの。今度、落ち着いてる時にまた……ね？」=“Ah... Sorry, I can't do it right now. Maybe once things have calmed down a bit, invite me again?”
「コイカツって私からお願いしてもいいの？　だったら今からどうかしら？」=“Would you mind if I wanted to do some love activities? If no, how about right now?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。それじゃ早速……何しましょうか？」=“Fufu, Thank you. Then, what shall we do?”
「あらら、忙しかった……かな？　ううん、大丈夫。次はきっと……お願いね」=“Oh dear, you were busy... huh? No, it's completely fine. Then... next time, okay?”
「今日、一緒に帰らない？」=“Wanna go home together?”
「ふふっ、いいわよ。タイミングばっちりだったわね」=“Fufu, sure. Great timing, too.”
「あ……今日はタイミング悪いわね。ごめんなさい」=“Ah... Sorry, I can't today. I have plans. Sorry.”
「ね、もし良かったら一緒に帰らない？」=“Hey, if it's fine with you, wanna walk home together?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。誰かと一緒に帰るのって楽しいわよね」=“Fufu, thank you. Walking home with someone else sure is fun, isn't it?”
「残念……それじゃ今日は一人で帰ろっかな。また誘うわね」=“Too bad... Then, I suppose I'll walk home by myself today. I'll invite you out again next time.”
「もし良かったら、俺とデートしない？」=“If it's alright with you, wanna go on a date with me?”
「そういうのはちょっと早すぎるわよ。お互いにもっとよく知ってから……ね？」=“I think that's still a bit too fast for us. Maybe after we get to know each other better...?”
「俺、[H名]とデートしたいんだ。どうかな？」=“I really wanna go on a date with you, [H名]. How about it?”
「ええ、喜んで。私もデートが楽しいお年頃……ですもの。ふふっ♪」=“Okay, I'll gladly go. I'm just at that age too... where dating sounds like a fun time. Fufu ♪”
「あ……ごめん、最近忙しくて……決して嫌なわけじゃないの。本当よ？」=“Ah... Sorry. I've been a bit busy lately... It's not that I don't want to. Really.”
「……あのね、キミさえ良かったら……私とデートしない？」=“...Hey, if it's alright with you... wanna go on a date with me?”
「ありがとう！　こういうのって切り出す方が緊張するわね」=“Thank you! Just trying to bring it up made me so nervous.”
「そう……残念……でも次回に期待するわね」=“Ah... I see... Too bad. But, I'll still be looking forward to the next time.”
「一緒に勉強しようよ」=“Let's study together.”
「ありがとう。私も誰かとしたかったの。一人だと集中出来なくて」=“Thank you. I've also been wanting to do it with someone else. I can't concentrate on it by myself.”
「ごめんね。勉強はしなきゃいけないんだけど、今は無理なの」=“I'm sorry. While I really want to study together, I can't do it today.”
「ね、たまには一緒に勉強なんてどうかしら？」=“Hey, how about we study together from time to time?”
「ふふっ、嬉しい。こういうの、学生らしくていいわよね」=“Fufu, I'm glad. Things like these, they really make me feel like I'm living my school life to the fullest.”
「うーん、一人で頑張れるかしら……なんて、大丈夫♪　今度またよろしくね」=“Hmm... I wonder if I can work hard by myself... Just kidding, It's fine ♪ Then, next time.”
「これから運動するんだけど、よかったら一緒にどう？」=“I'm going to do some physical activity after this, if you'd like, wanna join me?”
「あら、いいわね。何となく身体を動かしたい気分だったの」=“Oh, Sure. I've been feeling like stretching out my body for a while now anyway.”
「あ……ごめんね。今はそんなに元気がなくて……」=“Ah... Sorry. I'm not feeling super well right now...”
「もし良かったら、私と一緒に運動しない？」=“If it's alright with you, wanna do some exercise with me?”
「ありがとう！　男の子と身体動かすなんて、いい汗かけそうね」=“Thank you! Doing physical activities with a boy will surely make me work up quite the sweat.”
「あら、ダメだった？　それじゃまた今度お相手してね」=“Oh, is it no good? Then, maybe next time.”
「[H名]はコイカツ部に興味ない？　もし良かったら入って欲しいんだけど……」=“Hey, [H名], do you have any interest in the Koikatsu Club? If it's alright, I'd like for you to join...”
「ごめんなさい、もう少し考えてもいいかしら？」=“I'm sorry, can I have some more time to think about it?”
「あのね、私、コイカツ部のことが気になるの。入部希望なんだけど……いいかしら？」=“Hey, uhm, I'm a bit interested in the Koikatsu Club. I want to join it... Can I?”
「付いてきてもらってもいい？」=“Hey, can you follow me somewhere?”
「ええ、どうしたの？」=“Alright, what is it?”
「待って待って。今は無理よ。ちょっと用事があるの」=“Wait, wait. I can't right now. I have something to do.”
「こんなところに来て何する気？　もう……男の子って本当にエッチなんだから」=“What are you planning to do, bringing me to a place like this? Sheesh, boys, always only thinking about lewd things.”
「ねぇ、ここが女子トイレだって分かって入ってきたでしょ？　そう言うことしちゃ、めっ、よ？」=“Hey, you entered this place knowing this is the girl's toilet, yeah? You know that doing something like that is wrong, yes?”
「も、もうっ……こんなところで男子と一緒だなんて……誰かに見られたら絶対怪しまれるでしょ」=“J-Jeez... Being in a place like this with a boy... If someone saw us, they'll definitely think we're doing something suspicious...”
「キミはこんな場所に興味があるヘンタイさんなのかしら？　ん？」=“Having an interest in a place like this, Are you a pervert? Hmm?”
「ごめん、キミとは話す時間もないし興味もないの」=“Sorry, I don't have neither the time to talk to you nor an interest in doing so.”
「ふんだ。こう見えて結構怒ってるんですからね」=“Hmph! Even tho it may not seem like it, I'm actually quite angry, alright?”
「ごめんね……時間がある時に、またゆっくり話しましょう」=“I'm sorry... Let's catch up properly when I have some free time.”
「こ、こういうの……改めて見られるのって……恥ずかしいのよ？」=“T-This... Being seen like this again... It's really embarrassing, you know?”
「こらこら、そんなにジロジロ見ないの。キミ、軽蔑されちゃうわよ？」=“Hey, Come on, Don't stare at me like that. I'll start hating you at this rate, you know?”
「え、えっと……どうかしら？　なによ、お姉さんだって緊張くらいするんだから」=“U-Uhm... What is it? Don't stare like that, this onee-san gets nervous easily...”
「へぇ、女子の水着……そんなに興味あるんだ。まったく……男の子ってどうしようもないんだから」=“Huh, So you were that interested... in a Girls' Swimsuit? Seriously... Boys really can't be helped...”
「あ、キミも来たのね。こういう日の屋上って最高よね。一緒にくつろぎましょ」=“Ah, you came as well, huh? Being on the roof on a day like this sure is great, isn't it? Let's chill out together.”
「ふふっ、なんていうか……廊下で会えただけでも嬉しいなって思っちゃう……私、変なのかも」=“Fufu, for some reason... just meeting like this in the hallway makes me so incredibly happy... Maybe I'm strange...”
「静かな場所でキミと一緒……ふふっ、考えただけでドキドキするわね」=“Being in a quiet place, together with you... Fufu, just thinking about it makes my heart throb so fast.”
「何かしら？　二人きりじゃないと話せないことなのよね？」=“What is it? It's something we can't talk about unless we're alone, isn't it?”
「こらこら待ちなさい。そんなとこに入ったら冗談じゃすまなくなるわよ？」=“Hey, wait, stop right there. If you enter a place like that, I won't be able to excuse it as just a joke, okay?”
「ふふっ、キミとのデート、すごく楽しみ……私にだって乙女チックな妄想くらいあるのよ？」=“Fufu, a date with you, I'm super looking forward to it... I have girly fantasies too, you know?”
「キミと一緒にいる時の私、自分でも舞い上がっちゃってるなぁって思うわ。恥ずかしい……」=“Whenever I'm with you, I get so excited I surprise myself. It's so embarrassing...”
「今まで男の子の知り合いって少なかったから……その……色々なとこ、気になっちゃうな」=“I've not had many male friends till now so... that is... I'm so curious about so many things.”
「キミが見てくれるなら、はりきって活躍しなきゃね」=“With you watching me like that, I can't help but also enthusiastically do club activities.”
「あら、見学に来てくれたの？　もしかして私に会いに来てくれた……とか？」=“Oh dear, came to take a look at the club? Or maybe... Did you come to meet me, perhaps?”
「今コイカツ中なの？　ふふっ、部長さんは大忙しね。応援してるわ」=“Busy with club activities? Fufu, Mr Club President is always so busy. I'll cheer you on.”
「ふぅ、ようやく長い休み時間……ここでしっかりリフレッシュしなきゃね」=“Fuu, Finally a long break... Should properly relax and refresh while we can.”
「最近思うんだけど……学生にとってのメインイベントって、やっぱり放課後じゃないかしら？」=“I've been thinking this for a while now but... the main event of the day for any student has to be the after-school free time, no?”
「ひゃぁんっ！？　あ、キミ……も、もう……ちょっとエッチな声聞かれちゃった♪」=“Hyan!? Ah... It's you... J-Jeez... You made me let out such a lewd voice ♪”
「ふふっ、今日はどんなお話出来るのかしら？　キミとだったら毎回新鮮よ」=“Fufu, What shall we talk about today? If it's with you, no matter what we talk about, it always seems fresh”
「家に帰ったらすぐ部屋着になるタイプ？」=“Are you the type to change into loungewear as soon as you get home?”
「うーん、そうね。こう見えてわりとゴロゴロしちゃうの。だから部屋着……かな」=“Well, Yeah. Even if I seem like this, I actually lounge about a lot at home. That's why, I suppose it is loungewear, yea.”
「ううん、まずは私服に着替えるわ。だってまたコンビニとかに出かけるかもしれないし……ね？」=“No, I generally tend to dress into plain clothes instead. After all, you never know if you might have to go to a convenience store or whatever... you know?”
「わりと夜更かしとかする？」=“Do you stay up late often?”
「するする。夜中のテレビって面白くって……お肌には良くないんだけどね……」=“I do, I do. I really like watching late night shows. Although, I hear it's not good for your skin to stay up late...”
「実は私、夜に弱いの。すぐに眠くなっちゃって……あー、お子様だって思ったでしょう？」=“Actually, I'm rather bad at doing that. I always feel super sleepy at night... Ah~, you think I'm like a little kid, don't you?”
「行ってみたい場所とかある？」=“Is there any place you'd like to visit?”
「ええ、あるわよ。ちょっと遠くの温泉なんだけど……キミ、いつか一緒に行ってくれる？」=“Yes, there is. It's an onsen quite a ways away from here... Wanna go there together sometime?”
「私って意外とインドア派なのよ。だからあんまり遠出に興味はないかな」=“I'm actually quite the indoor type. That's why, I don't really have that much of an interest in visiting far away places.”
「アニメとか見るのかな？」=“Do you watch things like anime?”
「実は結構見るのよ。そしてよく泣いちゃったり……えー、最近のは本当に泣けるんだってばー」=“Actually, I watch a lot of anime. I cry a lot watching it too... Ehh, It really does make me cry a lot lately~”
「アニメよりは洋画を観ることが多いわね。吹き替えじゃなくて字幕派よ」=“Rather than anime, I actually watch a lot of western movies. Also, rather than dubs, I prefer subs.”
「あ、そういう話題はちょっと……違うこと話そっか」=“Ah, that topic is a bit... let's talk about something else.”
「この間、たまたま布団を干してきた時に限って……」=“Recently, sometimes, but only when my futon is being aired out...”
「あぁ……降っちゃうわよね……うん、早退するわけにもいかないし……がっかりよね……」=“Aahh... It starts pouring or snowing... Yeah, it's not like you can leave class early to take care of it either... It's so disappointing isn't it.”
「あのさ、たまには俺も『お姉さん』って呼んでみていい？」=“Hey, Do you mind if I call you "Onee-san" sometimes too?”
「別に構わないけど……キミ、そういうのが好きなの？」=“I don't particularly mind but... you, I didn't know you liked that kind of thing.”
「もしかして恋愛に溺れるタイプ？」=“Are you perhaps the type to lose your head over things like love?”
「そ、そうよ。悪い？　ふんだ、どうせキミに出会うまでは気付きませんでしたよーだ。もう……大好きっ♪」=“T-That's right. Is it bad? Hmph, It's not like I cared that much about it before I met you anyway. Jeez... I love you ♪”
「お姉さんがそういうタイプに見える？　しっかり自立した女性でしょ？　もう」=“Does this onee-san really look like that type of person to you? Don't you actually mean an independent woman instead? Jeez.”
「連絡はマメな方がいい？」=“Would it be better for me to contact you often?”
「そうねぇ……あんまり連絡がないと寂しいし、心配しちゃうかしら。あ、もちろんキミはマメにしてくれるわよね？」=“Yeah, probably... I'd feel lonely if I wasn't contacted much, and I'd also start worrying. Ah, of course, you'll keep in touch a lot, yeah?”
「私自身が筆無精だしなぁ。メールとか結構苦手だし……一日一回とかでも満足よ？」=“For me, I'm not the type that likes typing very much, and I'm not that good with email and such either... I'm fine with just once per day, you know?”
「恋人に求める、絶対に譲れない条件とかある？」=“While searching for a lover, is there anything in particular you'd never concede?”
「そんなの……私が好きになる人、に決まってるわ。そして願わくば、私を好きになってくれる人、ね」=“That... A person who I could grow to love, of course. And if possible, someone who could love me back.”
「特にないかな。条件とか考えなくても、気付いたら好きになっちゃってたもの。なっちゃってたもの！」=“Not particularly, no. Before I could even think about any sort of prerequisite, I realized I had already fallen in love. I've already fallen in love!”
「彼氏のこと、格好いいって思ってる？」=“About your boyfriend, do you think he's cool?”
「へぇ、それを聞いちゃいますか……仕方ないなぁ、もう……ふふっ、世界で一番、格好いいって思ってるわよ♪」=“Huh, you really wanna hear that... Nothing to be done about it. Sheesh... Fufu, I think you're the coolest person in the whole world ♪”
「思ってないわよ。あ、もしかしてヘコんじゃったかしら？　ふーんだ、そんな恥ずかしい質問した罰よ♪」=“No, I don't think he's cool. Ah, does that make you feel depressed? Heh, that's your punishment for asking such an embarrassing question ♪”

「特殊な性癖とかってある？」=“Do you have any particularly peculiar fetishes or anything?”
「えっと……敢えて言うならＢＬ……うそ、ごめんなさい、何でもない！　何でもないったらー！」=“Uhm... If I have to pick, I suppose BL... No, I'm sorry, It was a joke! Seriously, It was a joke!”
「そんなこと自分じゃ分かんないわよー。みんな自分のことはノーマルだと思ってるものよ？」=“Something like that, I don't think anyone really knows about themselves. Doesn't everyone think themselves as normal?”
「背中って感じるかな？」=“Do you feel any sensation in your back?”
「ぞくぞくはしちゃうけど……それって感じるってことなの？　あ、なにその目、やらしいんだから」=“I do feel a shiver down it but... Is that what you mean by "feel"? Ah, what's with those lewd eyes?”
「触ると痒くならない？　うそ、私だけ？　やーん、ムードなくてごめんなさい」=“Doesn't it feel itchy when touched? No way, is it just me? Ehh, Sorry, I'm not in the mood right now.”
「自分はＭだと思う？」=“Do you think you are an M?”
「うーん、女の子って基本はＭの娘が多いんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで一般論よ？」=“Well, don't you think that generally there are a lot of girls who are masochists? Ah, that's just the general opinion tho.”
「ふふっ、私は間違いなくドＳね。キミのこと、いっぱい苛めたいもの……って、本気で答えたらどうする気なの？」=“Fufu, I am unmistakably a hard S. I really want to tease you all day... If I actually replied with that seriously, what would you do?”
「鏡とかでさ、自分のアソコをじっくり見たことある？」=“Hey, have you ever, by using a mirror or whatever, properly taken a look at your nether regions?”
「恥ずかしいこと平気で聞くんだから……その、あるわ。だって、気になったんだもの……」=“You really ask the most embarrassing things so easily... Yes, I've done that. I mean, I was curious...”
「じっくりと見たことは……って、なに真面目に答えてるの、私！」=“I really have take a good... Wait, why are you answering this so earnestly, Me!?”
「今、恥ずかしい話はちょっと……他のこと話しましょう」=“Talking about such embarrassing things is a bit... Let's talk about something else.”
「エッチって……なんだろうね」=“I wonder... what is H, really?”
「哲学？　よく分からないけど、キミがにやにやしてることだけは分かるわね」=“An interest in philosophy? I don't particularly know what it is myself, but the one thing I do know is that you're grinning ear-to-ear.”
「この間、道ばたにエッチな道具が落ちてて……」=“The other day, I was walking on the roadside when I saw some sex toys on the side...”
「ど、どんな道具かしら……男性用？　女性用？　あっ、ち、違うのよ。ちょっと気になっただけ」=“W-What kind of toys... Mens' toys? Womens' Toys? Ah, I-It's not like that, I was just a bit interested, that's all.”
「友達からね、恋人よりは姉にしたいタイプって言われちゃった。そうかしら？」=“I heard from a friend, that I'm an elder sister type rather than a lover type. Is that really so?”
「むぅ……キミも姉にしたいのね。姉で恋人？　や、やだ……それはちょっと……いいかも♪」=“Muuu... You too, huh? An elder sister lover? Oh, Oh dear... That might be a bit... too good ♪”
「ふふっ、そうよね。私だって女の子なんだから。きちんと恋人になりたいのよ」=“Fufu, that's right. I'm a girl too in the end. I want to properly become someone's lover.”
「恋愛において、キミはリードする方……なのかな？」=“Regarding Love and stuff, are you the leading type?”
「ふふっ、だったら全部お任せしちゃおうかしら。私、そういうことに疎くって」=“Fufu, then maybe I'll leave it all to you. I'm not good with that sort of stuff anyway.”
「ええ、リードされたいの？　どうしよう……私、これからいっぱい勉強しなきゃ」=“Ehh, You want me to take the lead? What should I do... I think I'll have to start studying relaly hard.”
「エッチしててもプラトニックな関係って……あるわよね？」=“There are those types of people, aren't there, who have a platonic relationship even tho they do lewd things together... Friends with Benefits?”
「ふふっ、そうよね。肉体関係＝不純ってわけじゃないものね」=“Fufu, that's true. Sexual Relations aren't automatically impure, are they?”
「うーん、やっぱりそうなのかしら。身体のことが絡むと、どうしても欲望が前面に出ちゃうものね」=“Well, I suppose that is true. If you have a relationship like that, desires always come out to the forefront, don't they.”
「ね、ちょっとだけ手を握ってもいい？」=“Hey, is it alright if we hold hands for a bit?”
「うん、いいよ」=“Yeah, it's fine.”
「はぁ……やっぱり男の子の手って全然違うんだ……何度触っても感動しちゃうわ」=“Haa... As expected, a boy's hand is completely different from a girl's hand... No matter how many times I touch it, it makes me so excited...”
「昨日、寝る前にキミのことを考えてみたの」=“Last night, before I went to sleep, I was thinking about you.”
「え……まさかエッチな……」=“Eh... It was lewd stuff, wasn't...”
「違うわよ！　もう、どうしてすぐそういう方向にいくのかしら」=“No, not at all! Jeez, why do you always automatically jump to that conclusion.”
「最近ね、大人っぽくなったって言われるの。どうかな？」=“Recently, people have been telling me that I've become more mature. What do you think?”
「うーん、出会った頃からわりと大人っぽかったよ？」=“Well, you've been pretty mature ever since we met.”
「そうよね。私もそう思うんだけど……。自覚はなくても、やっぱり恋愛すると変わるのかしら……？」=“That seems true. I think so too... I suppose even if you don't notice it, you're bound to change when you fall in love...”
「ねぇ……今から言う質問は絶対他言しちゃダメよ？　絶対よ？　あのね……私のおっぱい……好き？」=“Hey... The question I'm about to ask, promise me you won't tell anyone else, alright? Just... well... My boobs... do you like them?”
「ふふっ、嬉しい。これからますます大きくなって、キミ好みになったらいいなぁ」=“Fufu, I'm glad. It would be great if they continued getting bigger and becoming more of your type”
「ありがとう。ちょうど良いサイズって言われるの、すごく嬉しい！」=“Thank you. Hearing you say that they're the perfect size, it makes me really happy!”
「実は小さくてコンプレックスだったんだけど……キミがそう言ってくれるなら、もう自慢のおっぱいね」=“Actually, I've always had a bit of a complex about how small they are... but if you say that, then these breasts are something I can finally be proud of.”
「私くらいの身長って……キミの好みに合ってるのかしら？」=“Girls about my height... Do they match your tastes?”

「特徴ない体型だけど、キミが褒めてくれるなら……それでいいの。ふふっ」=“It's not a particularly impressive figure, but if you're praising me like this, then it's alright I suppose. Fufu”
「太りたくても太れない体質だから……そう言ってもらえると嬉しい。これからも維持するからね」=“I have a constitution where I can't put on weight even if I want to, so hearing you say that makes me happy. I'll keep trying.”
「そうなの……？　お姉さん、ちょっとだけ寂しいなー……なんて」=“Really...? Onee-san feels a tad bit lonely... Just kidding”
「キミはまず恋人に対して何をするべきか、よく考えてみることね」=“You should try and think a bit harder about what you ought to do for your lover.”
「うん、こちらこそごめんなさい。本当はすごく寂しかったの……」=“Yeah, I'm sorry too. The truth is, I've just been so lonely...”
「ねぇ、謝れば許してもらえると思ってない？　そうやって適当になっていくのが嫌なのに……」=“Hey, do you really think that I'll forgive you if you just apologize? It's exactly that kind of half-assed behaviour of yours that I hate...”
「ん？　なになに？　どうしたの？」=“Hmm? What? Something the matter?”
「もう、そうやってお姉さんを困らせないの。恥ずかしいでしょ」=“Jeez, Don't make your onee-san worried like that. It's embarrassing.”
「一体何が目的なのかしら？　お姉さん、深読みしちゃうからダメよ？」=“Just what on earth are you intending? I'll start reading too much into things, so don't do that”
「こら、今絶対エッチなこと考えてたでしょう？　気付かないと思ってるの？」=“Hey, just now, you were definitely thinking about lewd stuff, weren't you? You really think that I'm dense enough to not notice it?”
「男の子ってそんなにおっぱい好きなの？　それともキミが特別？」=“Do boys really love breasts that much? Or is it that you're a unique specimen?”
「やだ、私の彼氏って……もしかしておっぱいと付き合いたい人なのかしら……？」=“No way, my boyfriend... Is he really the type to go out with a walking pair of tits if he could...?”
「ねぇ、私はキミに謝って欲しいの。単純、簡単、明快、でしょ？」=“Hey, I want you to apologize to me. Simple, Quick and Uncomplicated, right?”
「わわっ、もうっ……前置きなしでいきなり……ううん、嫌じゃないよ♪」=“W-Woah, Jeez... No beating around the bush, huh?... No, I don't hate it ♪”
「何度も握られるのはちょっと……恥ずかしいよ？」=“Being grabbed like this again and again is a bit... embarrassing, you know?”
「何回もにぎにぎしないの！　こういうのはほら……そういう雰囲気の時にやることよ？」=“Stop grabbing me like this again and again! Things like this... We should only do it in, uh, that, kind of mood”
「やんっ……こ、こらっ、いくら恋人でもダメでしょ」=“Hyan... H-Hey, Cut it out, even if we're lovers, this kind of thing is no good.”
「うそ……キミ、そういうこと平気で出来ちゃう人なのっ……？」=“No way... Are you someone who lets it out that easily?”
「もう……お姉さん、本気で呆れちゃうわよ？　いいの？　これからそういう目で見ちゃうわよ？」=“Jeez... This onee-chan will actually get disgusted for real. Are you alright with that? Do you want me to look at you with those kinds of eyes?”
「あ……ふふっ、こういうのは嬉しいかも……」=“Ah... Fufu, this makes me happy...”

「さすがに恥ずかしいわよ。ほら、私だってもう立派に大人な女性なんだからー！」=“That's really embarrassing. After all, I'm a proper mature woman too--!”
「ひゃんっ……触られちゃっ……た……♪」=“Hyan~... I got felt... up... ♪”
「うーん、何が目的なのかしら？　ほっぺたの柔らかさは胸と一緒……じゃないわよね？」=“Hmm, I wonder what your aim is? You're not comparing the softness of my cheeks to my chest... right?”
「もうダメ！　ほっぺた触られる度にキスされるんじゃないかってドキドキするんだからー！」=“Cut it out with that! I'm getting too excited just wondering if you're going to kiss me everytime you touch my cheeks!”
「そういうことするなら、きちんと仲直りした後じゃないと嫌……かな」=“Unless you're gonna apologize and make up with me, doing something like that is a bit... I don't like it.”
「キミの近くにいればいるほどキミのこと好きになっちゃう。魔法みたいね」=“I've fallen in love with you to the point that just being next to you is enough. It's like magic.”
「キミが男の子だから……なのかな。私、いつも胸がドキドキして……身体、熱くなっちゃうの……」=“I wonder if it's because you're a boy... When I'm with you, my chest always starts throbbing... and my body becomes hot...”
「キミのこと、全部知りたくなっちゃった。たくさんお話しましょ？」=“I've become even more interested in you, to the point of wanting to know everything about you. Let's talk lots, okay?”
「ふふっ、キミのお顔をじっくり見てもいい時間ね。へぇ……肌綺麗なんだ……」=“Fufu, just gazing at your face is fun as well. Heh... it's so pretty...”
「私とは話すこともない……ってことかしら？」=“Is it that... there's nothing to talk about with me?”
「私、ちょっと限界かも……お互いに一度頭を冷やしてみましょう」=“I... think I've hit my limit... Let's both take some time to cool off.”
「ね……どうして私がこんな気分なのか……分かってくれる……わよね？　そうじゃなきゃ……ううん、なんでもない。それじゃ」=“Hey... I wonder why I'm feeling like this... you understand... right? If not... No, it's nothing. Then, see ya.”
「どうしてかしら？　どんどんキミの傍に近づきたくなっちゃう。私、引き寄せられてるみたい……またお話しましょうね」=“I wonder why it is? For some reason, I keep wanting to get even closer to you... It feels like I'm being pulled... Let's talk again sometime, alright?”
「あのね……キミといると、私、初めての気持ちになるの……大きな声じゃ言えない気持ちよ？　あはは、それじゃ、またね！」=“Hey, you know... When I'm with you, I feel these feelings that I've never felt before... Feelings that I can't say out loud... Ahaha, then, let's meet again!”
「ふふっ、そろそろ切り上げないといつまでも話しちゃいそうね。また次も楽しみにしてるわね」=“Fufu, if we don't cut it short here, we'll keep talking forever. I'm looking forward to the next time~”
「うん、このままだとずーっと話しちゃいそうだものね。またいつでも声をかけて」=“Yeah, at this rate, we'll end up talking all day. Call for me again sometime.”
「ええ、それじゃ。またね」=“Alright, then, next time.”
