「えっ？　ここ女子トイレよ？　はい、すぐに出ていこうね」=“Eh? This is the women's toilet, you know? Yes, let's leave quickly.”
「……こんな場所にキミがいちゃダメでしょ！？　もしかしてどこかと間違えた？」=“...You know you shouldn't be here, right!? Did you confuse this place with somewhere else?”
「あ、今ちょっと忙しいの。ごめんね」=“Ah, I'm a bit busy right now. Sorry.”
「……何か用かしら？」=“...Do you need something?”
「あー、今時間がないの。ごめん、タイミング悪かったね」=“Ah, I don't have time right now. Sorry, you just caught me at a bad time.”
「すぅ……すぅ……んん……今日も頑張る……」=“Haah... Haah... Mmm... I'll work hard today as well...”
「こらっ！　こんな格好は見ちゃいけません！」=“Hey! You shouldn't go around looking like that!”
「水着姿、結構自信あるんだけど……あはは、やっぱり恥ずかしいね」=“I'm pretty confident how I look in my swimsuit, but... Ahaha, it's still pretty embarrassing after all.”
「ふぅ……ここからの眺めって気持ちいいのよね」=“Phew... It feels good to see the view from up here.”
「廊下は走っちゃダメよ？」=“You shouldn't run in the hallways, okay?”
「しーっ、図書室では静かにしなきゃ……迷惑かけちゃダメよ？」=“Shh, you have to keep quiet in the library... Don't cause any trouble okay?”
「付いていくのは構わないけど、どこまで行くのかな？」=“I don't mind following you, but where are we going, exactly?”
「ちょっ、どこに入ろうとしてるの！　ダメよっ！」=“Hey, where are you trying to go?! Not there!”
「あっ……ふふっ、キミと話せると思うと何だか楽しくなっちゃうな」=“Ah... Fufu... Just thinking about having a chat with you makes me happy.”
「そういえば……キミって男の子なのよね……あ、ううん、深い意味はないわよ」=“Come to think of it... You really are a boy... Ah, no, I didn't mean anything by that.”
「キミも一緒にやってみる？　運動不足の解消になるわよ」=“Wanna try it with me? It'll make up for your lack of exercise.”
「あら……もしかして、うちの部に興味あるの？」=“Oh... Are you perhaps interested in our club?”
「コイカツ部の活動中？　いいねぇ、青春だねぇ！」=“In the middle of Koikatsu club activities? That's great, that's youth for you!”
「ふふっ、この時間こそ至福よね」=“Fufu, this time is to be cherished.”
「今日も一日、よく頑張りました！　私から『お疲れ様』の魔法を授けましょう」=“You worked really hard today! Then, I'll bestow upon you the magic words, "Thanks for your hard work".”
「ひゃんっ！　キミいたの！？　もー、びっくりするじゃない」=“Hyan! You were there!? Geez, you startled me.”
「あら、どうしたの？」=“Oh, what's wrong?”
「周りから頼られそうなイメージあるけど……大変じゃない？」=“You have an aura of reliableness... isn't it hard?”
「ううん、頼られるのは好きよ？　キミも頼ってくれていいからね」=“Nope, doesn't everyone like being relied on? You can rely on me too.”
「うーん、そんなイメージあるかなぁ？　よくサバサバしてるって言われるから、そのせいかしら」=“Hmm, I wonder if I really give off that kind of an aura? People do say I'm fairly laid back, maybe it's that.”
「やっぱり女子って甘いお菓子が好きなのかな？」=“So girls really do like sweets, right?”
「ええ、私は好きよ。新製品はついつい買っちゃう」=“Yup, I really like them. I'm always buying out the new ones that come out.”
「んー、友達は大体好きかも。私？　私は辛いお菓子が好きな人」=“Mmm, I think my friends like them a lot. Me? I'm the type who likes spicy things more.”
「何だか時々すっごく年上に感じることがあるよ」=“For some reason, from time to time, I feel like I'm much older.”
「あはは、実はすっごくすっごく年上なのかもよ？　なーんて」=“Ahaha, don't you mean really, really old? Just kidding.”
「もー、女性に対して失礼じゃないかなぁ？　ま、別に嫌じゃないけど」=“Geez, isn't that quite a rude thing to say to a girl? Well, it's not like I really mind.”
「うーん……今は何か別の話しましょうか」=“Hmm... Let's talk about something else right now.”
「予習復習って簡単に言うけど……」=“It's easy to say that I'll study but...”
「そうそう、キツいよね。毎日の時間は限られてるっていうのにさー」=“Right, right, it's tough. Especially since we only have so many hours in a day for ourselves.”
「この間、街で迷子を見かけたんだけど……」=“I saw a lost kid in the city the other day...”
「きちんと交番に連れて行ってあげたんだ？　偉い！　私が褒めてあげよう！」=“Did you take them to the police station properly? That's great! For that, I'll praise you!”
「学園までの道ってさ、結構ゴミが多くない？」=“Don't you think there's too much garbage on the way to school?”
「ポイ捨てしてる人がいるんだよ。許せないなぁ」=“There's some people who are littering. It's pretty unforgiveable.”
「合コンとかセッティングしたりする？」=“Wanna set up a mixer or something?”
「一度、頼まれて挑戦はしたんだけど……男友達がいなくて無理だったよ」=“I did give it a try once, but... it didn't work out since I didn't have any guy friends.”
「しないしない。大体、男子の知り合いなんて、キミ以外いないし」=“I haven't, I haven't. In the first place, I don't know any guys other than you.”
「勝手なイメージだけど……よく恋愛相談とかされそうだよね」=“Maybe it's just me but... it looks like people often ask you for love advice.”
「まぁ、ないことはないけど……的確なアドバイスが出来てるかどうかは謎よ？」=“Well, it's not like there aren't any but... you never actually know whether or not my advice is good or not, right?”
「あー、そういうイメージかぁ。でも実はね、一度も相談されたことないの」=“Ah, I do have that kind of image, don't I? But, to be honest, no one has ever asked me for any such advice.”
「好きな男性のタイプってどんな感じ？」=“What kind of a guy is your type?”
「即答で優しい人。優しければあとは気にしないかな」=“To put it simply, a kind person. As long as they're kind, I guess I don't really mind anything else.”
「うーん、タイプって言われても……自分に合う人？　かしら？」=“Well, even if you say type... a person that fits me? I guess?”
「こういう話ってちょっと難しいというか、恥ずかしいというか……別の話題にしましょ？」=“Talking about this kind of stuff, it's kinda hard, or rather, it's sort of embarrassing... Can we talk about something else?”
「コイバナかぁ……うーん、女子と恋愛のことを話すって難しいなぁ」=“Love talk, huh... Well, talking with girls about love and stuff is pretty difficult.”
「うんうん、分かるよ。異性だもんね」=“Yeah, yeah, I totally get you. It's with the opposite sex afterall.”
「コイカツ部部長としては、恋愛に詳しくないといけないんだよね」=“As the president of the Koikatsu club, I need to be familiar with things related to romance, right?”
「活動しながら徐々に詳しくなればいいんじゃない？　焦ることないわよ」=“Isn't it fine to become familiar with that kind of stuff while doing club activities over time? There's no need to be impatient.”
「この学園って、女子同士の恋愛とかは……」=“At this school, are there lesbian couples...?”
「わわ、いきなり禁断ゾーンに踏み込んだわね。あるかもしれないしー、ないかもしれないしー……あはは」=“Woah, suddenly stepping into a forbidden zone, huh. Maybe there are, maybe there aren't... Ahaha.”
「積極的な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about proactive guys?”
「いいんじゃない？　ぐいぐい引っ張ってくれる人、好きよ」=“Aren't they alright? Guys who can strongly take the lead, I like them.”
「積極性を強引と履き違えてたら……嫌ね」=“One can easily mistake coercion as proactiveness so... I don't like it.”
「慎重な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about careful guys?”
「物事をしっかり考えてくれそうで……安心できるかも」=“They think carefully about everything so... I feel like they're reliable.”
「ダメダメ、男の子なら時に大胆に！　時にアグレッシブに！　でしょ？」=“No good, no good, I think guys have to be bold and daring at times! Sometimes you have to be aggressive! You get me?”
「勤勉な男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about diligent guys?”
「真面目なのは悪いことじゃないわ。尊敬できるわね」=“It's not a bad thing to be serious and earnest. In my opinion, they're respectable.”
「私がいい加減だからなぁ。あんまり堅苦しいのはちょっと……」=“I'm a bit irresponsible, as you know. Those kinds of people are a bit too stiff for me...”
「マイペースな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think of guys who always move at their own pace?”
「周りに流されないのは素敵かも。自分がある！　って感じがするでしょ？」=“The idea of not being caught in the flow of others is wonderful, I think. I have myself! Doesn't it sort of feel like that?”
「独りよがりな感じがして苦手ね。空気が読める人の方がいいわ」=“I'm not good with those sorts of people, they're all a bit caught up with themselves. I'd rather prefer guys who can read the mood.”
「優しい男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about kind and gentle guys?”
「すごくいいわね。優しさって、私にとっては最高のアピールポイントなんだけど……みんなは違うのかしら？」=“They're really nice. Kindness is one of the biggest appeal points for me, but... is that not the case for everyone?”
「優しいだけじゃ物足りないかな。たまには厳しくして欲しいものね」=“Kindness alone isn't enough, in my opinion. I hope that they can be strict at the right times.”
「クールな男性ってどう思う？」=“What do you think about cool guys?”
「冷静沈着、いいわね。そういう人には憧れるわ」=“Being cool, calm and collected sounds great. I really admire those kinds of people.”
「何だか一人で生きていけそうなイメージ。恋愛対象としては難しいかも」=“They feel like the types that prefer living alone, to me. I think it would be hard for me to think of them as potential love interests.”
「この年頃ってみんなエッチなことに興味あるのかな？」=“I wonder if everyone at this age is interested in stuff like sex.”
「おー、さすが男の子。キミはそういうことに興味があるんだね？　ん？　ん？」=“Ah, as expected of a guy. So you have an interest in those sorts of things? Hm? Hm?”
「ここだけの話、私は無きにしも非ずだけど……みんなはどうかしらね」=“Just between you and me, I do have a certain amount of interest but... I wonder about everyone else myself.”
「エッチの時ってやっぱり男がリードするべきなのかな？」=“I wonder if guys should take the lead after all, when it comes to sex?”
「そうねぇ、やっぱりそれが普通なんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで私の意見よ？」=“Right, isn't that the norm after all? A-although, that's just my opinion, you know?”
「女子でもぐいぐい行く娘はいるんじゃない？　好みの問題は別として」=“Aren't there girls that get into the mood quite a bit? Aside from their matter of taste.”
「エッチな本とか読んだことある？」=“Have you read any porn magazines or the like?”
「まぁ、多少はね……クラスで回し読みとかするし……あ、でもソフトな方だと思うわよ？」=“Well, more or less... They're frequently passed around the class... Ah, but I think those were pretty softcore?”
「興味ないわけじゃないけど、あんまり機会がないかなぁ。でもキミ、女子にそんなこと聞いちゃうわけ？」=“It's not that I'm not interested, but I haven't gotten a chance. But, why are you asking girls that sorts of questions anyway?”
「こういうのってもっと仲良くなってから話すこと……よね？」=“This kind of thing, shouldn't we get to know each other better first... right?”
「この間観た洋画がさ、すごいベッドシーンで……」=“The other day I saw this western movie, and it had this amazing bed scene...”
「え、それ何て洋画？　私も観てみようかしら……なんちゃって」=“Eh, what movie was it? Maybe I'll try watching it... Just kidding.”
「エッチの時って……どうして女の子は声が出ちゃうのかな」=“When having sex... why do girls let out squeals like that?”
「いや、もうそれ完全にセクハラ発言だし……知ってても答えないわよ？」=“Hey, that's straight up sexual harrassment... I wouldn't tell you even if I knew.”
「あのね、この間、近所の猫がすっごい交尾してて……」=“You know, the other day, the neighbourhood cat was really going at it with another cat...”
「あははっ、もーっ、それで笑っちゃったら、私が下ネタ好きみたいになるじゃないー」=“Ahaha, geez, if someone saw me, they'll think I love dirty jokes.”
「私ってそんなにサバサバしてるように見えるかしら？」=“Do I really seem that easy-going and laid-back?”
「そっかぁ。やっぱりそういう風に見られちゃうのね。まぁ、間違ってはないけど、ふふっ」=“I see. So that's what I seem like to others afterall. Well, it's not like it's incorrect, fufu.”
「おお、キミはそういう風に見てくれるんだ。男子からの意見は貴重だね」=“Ooh, so that's how you see me. A guy's opinion is pretty valuable.”
「自分で考えるイメージと違うのかしら……？」=“I wonder if the image I try to maintain is acutally different...?”
「ねぇ、キミは動物とか好きな方かな？」=“Hey, do you like animals?”
「ふふっ、私も動物には目がないの。ほ乳類、爬虫類、魚類、なんでも好きよ」=“Fufu, I have a soft spot for animals too. Reptiles, mammals or fish, I like them all.”
「それじゃあ一緒だね。私も……ちょっと苦手……あはは」=“In that case, we're the same. I'm... not good with animals... Ahaha.”
「キミって男の子だし、やっぱりたくさん食べるのかしら？」=“You're a guy after all, so do you eat a lot?”
「ふふっ、私も同じよ。すっごく食べる方だから友達に驚かれちゃうの」=“Fufu, I'm the same. I eat so much that I surprise my friends.”
「そうなの？　なんだか意外ね。私もね、こう見えて小食なのよ？　あ、本当だってばー」=“That so? That's kinda unexpected. Me too, even though I look like this, I have a pretty small appetite. Ah, I'm telling you the truth.”
「キミって……なにげにお料理とか上手そうよね。よく作ったりするの？」=“You kinda... look like you'd be good at cooking. Do you cook pretty often?”
「私もお料理好きよ。今度一緒に何か作ってみない？」=“I love cooking too. Wanna try making something together sometime?”
「あらら、違った？　大丈夫、お料理なんて出来なくても平気よ。って、私もあんまり出来ないから人のこと言えないんだけど♪」=“Oh my, did I get it wrong? it's completely fine if you can't cook. Er, well I can't cook myself so it's not like I can talk about other people ♪”
「キミ、身体を動かすのって好き？　体育の授業とか……」=“Hey, do you like moving your body? Like during Phys Ed class...”
「そうなんだ。こう見えて私も好きなのよ。結構得意なんだから」=“Is that right. As you can tell, I like it too. I'm pretty good at it, you know.”
「やっぱりそういうタイプかー。ううん、大丈夫、私も苦手だもの」=“As I thought, you're that type of guy. Nah, it's okay, I'm not good with it either.”
「ね、キミは日頃から真面目に勉強するタイプ？」=“Hey, are you the kind of person to study hard everyday?”
「ふふっ、偉い偉い！　私もコツコツ派だから気が合うかもね」=“Fufu, good, good! I'm also in the "study hard" camp, so we might match.”
「そうよねー。しなきゃいけないとは思いつつ……私も……ふふっ」=“I feel that. It feels like you shouldn't not do it... I get that too... Fufu.”
「キミはおしゃれに気を遣ってるのかしら？」=“Do you go out of your way to try to be fashionable?”
「あら、さすがね。私も暇さえあれば洋服見ちゃう。見てるだけでも楽しいのよ」=“Oh, as expected. Sometimes I'll just go window shopping whenever I have time. Even just looking at them is fun.”
「無頓着なのね。実は私も……わりと気にしないの。幻滅しちゃった？」=“You don't care, huh? Actually, I... don't really care either... Did I disappoint you?”
「そっか、私とは違うのね」=“I see, we're different in that way I suppose.”
「ねぇ、男の子だったら女子が言って欲しい言葉くらい、分からない？」=“Hey, since you're a guy, don't you know what words a girl wants to hear the most?”
「あ……ふふっ、私こそ大人げなかったわね、ごめんなさい。仲直り……してくれる？」=“Ah... Fufu, I was being immature, I'm sorry. Will you... make up with me?”
「謝ったって、そう簡単には許してあげないんだから。こう見えて結構怒ってるのよ？」=“Even if you apologize, there's no way I can forgive you that easily. I'm actually pretty angry, you know?”
「うーん……私の顔、どこか変なところでもある？」=“Well... Is there something weird on my face?”
「もー、気になっちゃうでしょ。あんまりジロジロ見ちゃダメよ？」=“Geez, what is it? Don't stare at my face so much.”
「ダメだってば。さすがに怒るわよ？」=“I said no. I'll get mad for real.”
「……んー、どこ見てるのかな？　ん？　ん？」=“...Hmmm, I wonder where you're looking at? Hm? Hm?”
「そういうとこ、じーっと見るの良くないと思うなぁ。本気よ？」=“I don't think it's good for you to stare there so intently. I'm being serious.”
「キミがセクハラ男子になるのを見過ごすわけにはいかないわね。はい、もう禁止！」=“I can't overlook this sexual harrassment anymore. Here, that's enough!”
「……ジロジロ見たって何も変わらないよ」=“...Staring at it so intently won't actually make it change or anything, you know.”
「えっ……いきなりどうしたの？　私の手、何か気になる？」=“Eh... What's this all of a sudden? Why the sudden interest in my hand?”
「やんっ……もー、男子に手を握られるのって結構緊張するのよ？」=“Yah... Geez, it's nervewracking to have your hand suddenly grasped by a guy, you know?”
「そんなに触っちゃダメ。あんまりやりすぎると気持ち悪いって思っちゃうわよ？」=“Don't touch there so much. If you overdo it, I'll feel disgusted, you know?”
「ひゃんっ！　う、うそっ……わざとじゃない……わよね？」=“Hyan! N-no way... That wasn't on purpose... was it?”
「わざと触ってるの！？　こ、こんなことしちゃダメ……って、教えてあげなきゃ分からない？」=“Was that on purpose!? Y-you can't do things like that... Wait, why do I even have to explain it to you?”
「もう、分かっててやってるなら質が悪いよ？　いい？　こういうことはいけないことなの！」=“Geez, doing it when you know makes you even worse, you know? Got it? You can't go around doing things like this!”
「あら……頭、何かついてた？」=“Oh... Was there something on my head?”
「もう……誰にでも簡単にそういうことしちゃダメ。意外と特別なことなのよ？」=“Geez... You can't go around doing stuff like that to everyone so easily. It's actually a very special thing to do, you know?”
「お互いに誤解されたら困るでしょ？　だからここまで！　ね？」=“A misunderstanding about something like this will trouble us both, no? So, stop there! Alright?”
「こ、こらっ、いきなりなんてことするのっ！？」=“H-hey, what do you think you're doing all of a sudden!?”
「人のほっぺた触って喜ぶなんて悪趣味すぎるわよ、もう」=“Being that happy while touching someone's cheek is in bad taste, geez.”
「うーん、さすがの私もイライラしちゃいそうな空気……本気よ？」=“Um, even someone like me will get irritated if you keep this up... I'm being serious.”
「……何を考えてるの？」=“...What are you thinking?”
「ちょっとずつキミとの距離が縮まってる気がするわね。私の勘違い……じゃないといいんだけど♪」=“I feel like the distance between us is slowly decreasing. I hope that... I'm not the only one who feels this way ♪”
「男子との会話って新鮮ね」=“Having a conversation like this with a guy feels so refreshing.”
「うーん、何か楽しい話はないかしら……」=“Well, I wonder if there's anything fun to talk about...”
「キミって……聞きたい言葉も言ってくれずに放っておくのね」=“You're just... going to leave without saying the words I want to hear, huh.”
「……ごめんなさい、もうやめましょう。なんだかイメージと違う会話になっちゃったわね」=“...I'm sorry, let's stop here. Somehow this conversation turned out different from what I was expecting.”
「こういう状態で会話しても楽しくないわよね」=“It's not fun to have a chat in a situation like this.”
「キミと話してるとすごく楽しいわ。また色々話しましょ」=“It's really fun talking with you. Let's talk about tons of different things soon.”
「キミの話聞いてると……私、興味津々になっちゃう。何にって……それは秘密よ♪」=“Whenever you tell me something new... I always become super interested in it. Which parts...? That's a secret ♪”
「今回はここまでにしましょ。またね」=“Let's stop here for now. See you later.”
「ええ、それじゃこれで。キミさえ良ければ、また声かけてね」=“Yes, then let's stop here for now. If it's good with you, call me out for another chat, okay?”
「ふふっ、またね」=“Fufu, see you.”
「よかったら一緒に帰らない？」=“If it's alright with you, wanna walk home together?”
「ええ、いいわよ。ちょうど予定もなかったの」=“Yeah, alright. I don't have any plans for afterwards.”
「ごめんね、今日はちょっと用事があって……また今度誘ってね」=“Sorry, I have something planned for today... Invite me out again next time, okay?”
「よかったら一緒に勉強しない？」=“If you like, wanna study together?”
「ええ、やりましょ。一人でやるより二人の方が捗るものね」=“Alright, let's do it. As they say, two heads are better than one.”
「あ……今は無理なの、ごめんね。でも勉強はしたいから、機会があれば一緒にしましょ」=“Ah... I can't do it right now, sorry. But it's not because I don't want to study, if I get a chance, let's do it together.”
「一緒に身体を動かさない？」=“Do you want to exercise together?”
「ふふっ、奇遇ね。私も身体動かしたいなって思ってたところよ」=“Fufu, what a coincidence. I was just thinking about getting some exercise myself.”
「今はそういう気分じゃないかな。せっかく誘ってくれたのに、ごめんね」=“I'm not really in the mood for something like that. Even though you went out of your way to invite me, sorry.”
「ちょっと付いてきてもらっていい？」=“Can you come with me for a second?”
「ふふっ、どうしたの？」=“Fufu, what's up?”
「ごめん、今は無理なの。ちょっとタイミング悪かったかな」=“Sorry, I can't right now. Your timing is a bit bad.”
「ちょ、ちょっとなに普通に入ってきてるの？　誰かに見つかったら大問題よ？」=“J-just what are you doing, entering this place so casually? If someone finds you, that'll be a big problem, you know?”
「きゃーっ！　いくら男子トイレが少ないからって、ここは使っちゃダメよ！」=“Kyaa! No matter how few men's restrooms there are, you can't just come in here!”
「も、もー、私しかいなかったからいいものの……キミ、変なところで度胸あるのね」=“G-geez, it's fine since there wasn't anyone but me who would be okay with this... You sure have tons for courage for the weirdest things...”
「きゃっ！　こんなとこで何してるの！？　って、くつろいでないで早く出なきゃダメよ！」=“Kyaa! What are you doing in this place!? Hey, stop this isn't your place so hurry up and leave already!”
「あ、キミか……ふんだ」=“Ah, it's you... Hmph.”
「なんなの？」=“What is it?”
「あっ、ごめんね、今はちょっと忙しくて……また今度、ね？」=“Ah, sorry, I'm a bit busy right now... Maybe next time, okay?”
「ひゃあぁっ！　こんな姿見られたっ！　お嫁に行けなくなったら、キミが責任取ってくれるの？　なんちゃって」=“Hyaaa! To be seen like this! If I can't become a bride anymore, will you take responsibility? Just kidding.”
「こ、こらっ！　いくら興味があってもそんなにジロジロ見ちゃダメよ！」=“H-Hey! No matter how interested you might be, you can't just stare like that!”
「別に見られるのは嫌じゃないけど……やっぱり恥ずかしいわよね」=“While I don't particularly hate being seen like this... It's still embarrassing after all.”
「こういう姿を堂々と見るのもスゴイと思うなぁ、お姉さんは」=“Onee-san doesn't know whether to be shocked or amazed at how brazenly you're just staring at her...”
「ここに来ると、空って広いなぁって感動するのよねー」=“Whenever I come here, I'm always moved by how wide the sky looks.”
「うちの学園、廊下もぴかぴかでしょ？　女子校だから掃除も徹底してるのよ」=“Isn't the hallway in our school always spotless? Since it's an all-girls school, even the cleaning is always done thoroughly.”
「あ……キミも何か借りるの？　オススメの本とか教えてあげよっか？」=“Ah... Are you going to take something out too? Want any book recommendations?”
「きちんと付いてきてるわよ」=“I'm right behind you.”
「ちょっと、ちょっと！　どこに入ろうとしてるのっ」=“Wait, wait! Where do you think you're going?”
「ふふっ、今度のデート、すっごく楽しみにしてるからね。お姉さん、期待してるんだから」=“Fufu, I'm really looking forward to our next date. Onee-san is counting on you.”
「時々ね、キミのことすごいなぁって思うよ。尊敬しちゃう」=“Sometimes, I can't help but think how amazing you are. I really respect you.”
「うーん、キミを見てると男女の身体の違いが気になってきちゃうなぁ。あ、え、エッチな話じゃないよ？」=“Well, when I look at you, I can't help but notice how different a man's body is compared to ours. Ah, I-I wasn't talking about anything lewd, okay?”
「おー、まさか応援に来てくれたの？　頑張るよー！」=“Oh, have you come to cheer me on? I'll work hard-!”
「あら、うちの部に興味持ってくれてるのかしら？　体験してみる？」=“Oh, are you interested in our club? Wanna try it out?”
「部活に励んでるのねぇ、感心感心！」=“Working hard at club activities, huh. Impressive, impressive!”
「ふぅ、これでようやく一息ね。まぁ、午後は睡魔との戦いだけど」=“Phew, I can finally take a breather. Now it'll be another story fighting sleep in the afternoon.”
「んー、この解放感。毎日の楽しみね」=“Mm, this sense of freedom, I look forward to it everyday.”
「きゃんっ！　キミっ、いたの！？　へ、変な声聞かないでよ、もー」=“Kyaa! You were there!? I-I ended up letting out such a weird noise, geez.”
「なになに？　お姉さんに用かな？」=“What is it? You need something from this onee-san?”
「時々、お姉ちゃんっぽいって言われない？」=“Do people often tell you that you're like an onee-chan?”
「うんうん、よく言われるわよ。キミもそう感じるなら、これからは私のこと、お姉ちゃんだと思ってみる？」=“Yep, I get told that very often. If you feel the same way, you can think of me as your onee-chan as well, you know?”
「自分ではそう思われたいんだけど……意外と年下扱いされちゃったりするのよね……」=“I feel the same way about myself but... sometimes it's surprising when I'm treated like I'm younger than I am...”
「ニュース番組とかよく見る？」=“Do you often watch the news?”
「実は毎日チェックしてるの。ほら、私って大人でしょ？」=“I actually check the news daily. Aren't I mature?”
「うーん、あんまり見ないかなぁ。夜はドラマ観てることが多いの」=“Well, I don't check it that much to be honest. I mostly just watch dramas on at night.”
「この学園に入る前、共学に行こうって思わなかった？」=“Before coming to this school, did you ever think about being in a co-ed school?”
「一度は考えたわよ。でも……やっぱりこの学園がいいなって思ったの」=“I did think about it once, but... in the end, I've always felt this was school was the best choice.”
「ううん、考えたことないわね。私の雰囲気的にも女子校の方があってるでしょ？」=“Nope, I've never thought about that. Don't you think that my aura fits perfectly in an all-girls school setting?”
「家事とかは得意？」=“Are you good at housework?”
「見ての通り、一通りはこなせるわよ。こう見えて私、出来る女なんですからね」=“As you can see, I can do most of everything. Although I look like this, I'm a capable woman.”
「あ、あはは……あはははー……ノーコメントよ！」=“A-ahaha... Ahahaha-... No comment!”
「うーん、せっかくだからキミとは違うお話がしたいわね」=“Well, we don't get to talk often so I want to talk about something else with you.”
「この間の大雨の日、駅前の排水溝が……」=“The other day, when it raining super heavily, the drain in front of the station...”
「知ってる知ってる。噴水みたいになること、あるわよね」=“Oh, I know about this. It became like a water fountain, didn't it?”
「やっぱり彼氏とか欲しい？」=“So you want a boyfriend after all?”
「まぁ、そういうお年頃だしね。なに？　キミが立候補してくれたりするの？」=“Well, I am at that age. Why? Are you going to announce your candidacy for it?”
「うーん、はっきりイエスと答える自信はないわね。今は勉強も大変だし……」=“Well, I don't have the confidence to reply with a solid yes. Not to mention we're really busy with our studies as it is...”
「キスは相手からして欲しい？」=“Would you prefer your partner to initiate kisses?”
「そうね。ちょっと強引に……って、なに恥ずかしいこと言わせてるのよー」=“That's right. Being a bit pushy is... Hey, what kind of embarrassing things are you even making me say?”
「たまには私からしたい……かな。なーんて。あ、こら、変な目で見ないの！」=“Sometimes I wanna be the one who initiates them... I guess. Just kidding. Ah, hey, don't look at me weird like that!”
「結婚するとしたら、式って挙げたい？」=“If you ever get married, would you want a full blown wedding?”
「もちろん。私だって女の子ですからね。一生に一度くらいウエディングドレスを着てみたいわ」=“Of course. I'm still a girl afterall. I want to wear a wedding dress at least once in my life.”
「うーん、恥ずかしいから別に……あ、でもドレスは着たいから写真だけは撮りたいかな」=“Well, it's embarrassing so not really... Ah, but I do want to take a picture in a wedding dress if possible.”
「好きな人には積極的にアタックする？」=“Would you be proactive with the person you liked?”
「もちろん！　当たって砕けろが信条！　と言いたいところだけど……そう簡単にはいかないわよね」=“Of course! It's my belief to not beat around the bush! Or so I'd like to say but... it's easier said than done.”
「しないわよー。もー、私のこと、どんな人だと思ってるの？　心はすっごく乙女なんですからね」=“Of course not. Geez, what kind of person do you take me for? I'm actually a pure hearted maiden, you know.”
「待って待って。こういう話はまた別の機会にしましょ」=“Wait, Wait. Let's talk about stuff like this another time.”
「この間、街を歩いてたら痴話喧嘩を見かけて……」=“The other day, I was walking around town and I saw this couple having a lover's quarrel...”
「あはは……きっと喧嘩するほど仲が良い、って奴だよ」=“Ahaha... They must have been really close, to be able to quarrel like that.”
「日頃からエッチなこととか考える？」=“Have you been thinking about doing lewd things on a daily basis?”
「素直に言えばそうだけど……その質問をしたキミがすごいって思うわ」=“Being honest, that is the case, but... I can't help but be amazed that you have what to be able to ask that...”
「考えません！　……本当。本当よ！？」=“I do not at all! ...Really. I'm telling you the truth!”
「エッチってさ、男女でするだけじゃないって知ってる？」=“About sex, did you know that it's not only between a man and a woman?”
「え？　同性とってこと？　……まあ、知ってるわよ。ここ、女子校だし……」=“Eh? You mean two people of the same sex? ...Well, I do know about that. This is an all-girls highschool, so...”
「し、知らない知らない。一人でもするなんて知らないんだから！」=“I-I didn't know, I didn't know. I also don't know that you can do it by yourself, just so you know!”
「憧れのエッチとかある？」=“Is there any particular type of sex you long for?”
「ふふっ、あるわよ。昔観た映画でね、車の中で激しく……って、素敵だなって思っただけよ？」=“Fufu, there is. I saw it in a movie a long time ago, where they were doing it rough in a car... Er, I just thought it was pretty nice, that's all.”
「特にないわね……そういうシーンを観ても自分に置きかえて考えられないもの」=“Nothing in particular... Even if I saw such a scene in a movie, I don't think I could imagine myself in the same position.”
「エッチな夢とか見ちゃう？」=“Do you get wet dreams?”
「うぅ……たまにあるのよね……顔は分からないんだけど、すごく好きな人に抱き締められる幸せな夢」=“Uuu... Sometimes I do... Although I can't tell who it is from the face, it's always a good dream about me being hugged by the person I love the most.”
「多分ないと思うわ。起きたら忘れてるんですもの」=“Don't think I do. I always forget my dreams when I wake up anyway.”
「こんな話……いくらキミでもオープンすぎるわ。だからＮＧです」=“This kind of talk... Even if it's you, this is too personal, so it's no go for me.”
「耳年増な女の子って、どこで知識を得てくるんだろう」=“All those girls who consider themselves experts in sex, I wonder where they get all their information.”
「えっと……やっぱりネットじゃない？　いや、私は耳年増じゃないけどね？」=“Um... Probably the internet? No, I'm not saying that I'm like those girls though, okay?”
「私、こんなに仲良くなった男の子って初めてかも。キミはどうかしら？」=“This might be the first time I've ever been this close with someone of the opposite sex. How about you?”
「もー、嘘って分かってても嬉しいなぁ。これからも仲良くしましょうね」=“Geez, even though I know you're lying, it still makes me so happy to hear that. Let's get along even more from now on.”
「まぁ、そうよねー。キミは女子のお友達多そうだもの」=“Well, that'd make sense. You seem to have a lot of female friends after all.”
「キミ、コーヒーはブラックが好き？」=“Hey, do you like your coffee black?”
「やっぱりー。私も一緒。混じりけがないのがいいわよね」=“I knew it. I'm the same way. It's good when nothing is mixed in.”
「良かったー。お姉さんもブラック苦手……ミルクないときついのよね」=“I'm glad. This onee-san can't handle black coffee either... It's tough without at least some milk.”
「お料理って、辛い物は好き？」=“Do you like spicy food?”
「いいわね！　オススメのアジア料理屋さんあるから、今度一緒に行きましょう」=“That's great! There's some nice Asian restaurants that I know of, let's go together next time.”
「えへへ、実はお姉さんも無理ー。我慢して食べるのもつらいものね」=“Ehehe, actually, this onee-san can't handle it either. Even just enduring it is hard.”
「気になってたんだけど、キミは甘い物好き？　ほら、男の子だし、どうかなって」=“I was just thinking about this, but do you have a sweet tooth? Since you're a guy and all, so I'm curious.”
「なるほど、男の子でも甘い物好きはいるのね。私？　私はもちろん大好きよ」=“I see, so there are some guys who like sweets too. Me? I love them of course.”
「やっぱり？　男の子ってそういう子多いのかな？　私も苦手なんだけど、女子だと珍しい方なのよ」=“Is that so? I wonder if most guys feel the same way. I don't really like them either, but that's pretty rare for a girl.”
「あのね、参考までに聞かせて欲しいんだけど……理想のバストサイズって聞かせてくれる？」=“Hey, um, I'd like to ask you something for reference... Could you tell me what's your ideal bust size?”
「おお、それじゃ私も……って、なにジロジロ見てるの！　そういう意味で聞いたわけじゃないのよ」=“Oooh, so then I'm also... Eh, where do you think you're looking!? That's not why I asked.”
「ふふっ、そうよね。何事も普通が一番。うん、そうに決まってるのよ」=“Fufu, that's right. No matter what, average is the best. Yeah, that decides it.”
「うそ……本気で言ってくれてるの？　お姉さん感動しちゃうわよ？」=“No way... Are you telling the truth? You're not just playing with onee-san's feelings?”
「キミは女の子に対して好みの身長とかってある？　どれくらいの娘が好き？」=“Do you have a preferred height when it comes to girls? About how tall do you like them?”
「あら嬉しい。背が高いのって、実はちょっとコンプレックスだったりしたのよ」=“Oh, that makes me happy. I'm tall, so I actually have a bit of a complex about it.”
「なるほどなるほど。私くらいでちょうどいいかしら？」=“I see, I see. So, about my height is good then?”
「ふふふっ、今、生まれて初めて、身長低くて良かったって思っちゃったわ」=“Fufufu, for the first time in my life, I'm glad that I'm short.”
「女子に対して、体型の好みとか……もちろんあるわよね？　聞いてもいい？」=“When it comes to girls, like preference in body type... Of course you have them, right? Is it okay if I ask?”
「本当？　私くらいでも大丈夫？　もー、キミって優しいんだからー」=“Really? Am I good in that regard then? Geez, it's because you're so kind.”
「ふふっ、体型の維持って大変なんだけど……せっかくだから頑張っちゃおうかしら」=“Fufu, it's tough to maintain your figure but... I wonder if it's because it's so hard that I'm doing my best.”
「ふふっ、嬉しいこと言ってくれるなぁ。こう見えて私、細すぎるかもって気にしてたのよ」=“Fufu, you say some really nice things sometimes. It may not seem like it, but I was really worried that I was too thin.”
「そっか……私とは違うタイプね」=“That so... Different from me, huh.”
「お話をしたいのなら、まず最初に言わなきゃいけない言葉があるでしょう？」=“If you want to talk to me, isn't there something you have to say first?”
「ふふっ、私こそごめんなさい。もう怒ってない。だから……そんな顔しないの、ほら、男の子でしょ？」=“Fufu, I'm sorry too. I'm not mad anymore. So... don't make that kind of face, look, you're a man, aren't you?”
「そうやって適当に謝れば許してもらえると思ってるんでしょう」=“Don't think I'll forgive you so easily with such a half-baked apology.”
「そんなに見つめてどうしたの？　何か気になる？」=“You keep staring at me so much, what's up? You worried about something?”
「うーん、男の子の考えることって難しいわね……なにかしら……」=“Well, the things that go through a guy's head are hard to understand... I wonder what...”
「も、もー、分かったわ、私の負け！　恥ずかしいからもう見ないで？　ね？」=“G-geez, I get it, it's my loss! It's embarrassing so would you stop staring at me? Alright?”
「あ……キミ今……ふふっ、何でもない。それとも言ってあげた方がキミのためかしら？」=“Ah... Just now, you... Fufu, it's nothing. Or would it be better if I said it out loud, for your sake?”
「だから気付いてるってば。そういうところは見ちゃダメよ、もう」=“That's why I'm conscious of it! Don't stare at that place so much, geez.”
「キミ、わざとジロジロ見てるでしょう。いい加減にしないと、お姉さん怒っちゃうんだからね」=“You're staring at it so intently on purpose, aren't you? If you don't cut it out, onee-san will get mad, you know?”
「ジロジロ観察する前にやることがあるんじゃないかしら？」=“Isn't there something you should do before staring at me like that?”
「きゃっ……ど、どうしたの？　何か付いてた？」=“Kyaa... W-what's wrong? Did something happen?”
「あんまり気軽に触らないの。女子はデリケートなのよ？」=“Don't go around touching people so casually. Girls are very delicate, you know?”
「もー、ダメって言ってるでしょう。手を触られるだけで色々考えちゃうんだから！」=“Geez, I'm telling you can't. Just having my hand touched like that makes me thing of all kinds of stuff!”
「ひゃんっ！　え……な、なに、今何したの？　わざと……じゃないわよね？」=“Hyan! Eh... W-what did you just do? That was... on purpose, right?”
「ひゃぁっ！　わざと触ったの！？　あ、有り得ないと思うんだけど……」=“Hyan! Was that on purpose!? I-I thought that you wouldn't ever but...”
「はぅっ、さすがにもう触らせないわよ。セクハラなんだからね」=“Hauu, I won't let you touch me anymore. This is clearly sexual harassment.”
「あら……何かしら？　突然なでなでしたくなったの？」=“Oh... What is it? Did you have a sudden craving to pat someone's head?”
「むぅ……何だか小さな子みたいな扱い……私のキャラに合わないなぁ」=“Muu... Treating me like a little kid... I don't think it fits my character.”
「恥ずかしいからここまで！　さすがに照れちゃうわ」=“This is embarrassing so that's it! Any more and I'll become really shy and bashful.”
「ひゃんっ……むぅ、今、柔らかいとか思ったでしょう？」=“Hyan... Muu, just now, you were thinking that I was really soft, weren't you?”
「柔らかさを確認しなくていいの！　そんなに強く触ったら跡ついちゃう！」=“You don't have to confirm that it's soft! If you feel it up with so much strength, it'll leave marks!”
「こーらー、お姉さんをバカにしてると怖い目に遭わせちゃうわよー！」=“Look here, if you keep making fun of this onee-san, you'll find yourself having an encounter with a pair of scary eyes-!”
「キミはもっと空気を読むべきだと思うわ」=“I think you ought to learn how to read the mood a bit more.”
「キミと話してると何でも新鮮。わくわくしちゃうなぁ」=“If I'm talking with you, any old topic seems fresh. It makes me really excited.”
「男の子との会話って楽しいのね。ふふっ」=“Talking with a guy sure is fun, fufu.”
「誰かとおしゃべりするのってストレス解消にもなるのよ。キミも楽しんでくれてるかしら？」=“Chatting with someone sure works wonders for stress relief. Are you also having fun?”
「あら、難しい顔してどうしたのかしら？　何か楽しいお話を考えてくれてるの？」=“Oh, did something happen for you to make that serious face? Are you thinking of fun conversations to have?”
「こういう時に黙っちゃうなんて……はぁぁ」=“At times like these I should just be silent... Haah.”
「今の私、ちょっとイライラしちゃってる。何でだか……分かるわよね？」=“Right now, I'm a bit frustrated. You do you know why... right?”
「もう……全然すっきりしない。じゃあね」=“Geez... I can't seem to calm down. See you later.”
「今度またキミとお話出来るのが楽しみよ。色々なこと、聞かせてね」=“I'm looking forward to talking with you again. Let's talk about lots of things, alright?”
「健全なお話も楽しいけど……次回はもう少しドキドキするお話でも……なーんて。ふふっ、それじゃまたね」=“It is fun having wholesome conversations like this but... let's talk about more heart-throbbing things next time... just kidding. Fufu, I'll see you later.”
「楽しい時間をありがとう。またお話しましょうね」=“Thank you for such a fun time. Let's talk again sometime.”
「ええ、またいつでも声を掛けて。楽しみに待ってるわね」=“Yes, call for me again at any time. I'll be looking forward to it.”
「ええ、またね」=“Yes, see you later.”
「俺、[H名]のことが好きなんだ」=“I like you, [H名].”
「ありがとう。でも……ごめんなさい。今はまだそういうことは考えられないの」=“Thank you. But... I'm sorry. Right now, I still can't bring myself to think about that stuff.”
「ふふっ、嬉しい……私も自分の気持ちに向き合って気づいたの。キミが好きよ」=“Fufu, I'm happy... I've also noticed my own feelings for you. I like you too.”
「ごめんなさい。私……自分の気持ちが分からなくて……安易には決められないわ」=“I'm sorry. I... still haven't sorted out my feelings... I can't do it so quickly and carelessly.”
「……わ、私っ、キミのことが好きっ……だからそのっ……もしよかったら付き合ってくれない……かな？」=“...I-I-I really like you... That's why... If you'd like... won't you go out with me?”
「あ……ありがとう！　すっごく嬉しいっ！　ふふっ、安心したら力抜けちゃった……」=“Th-... thank you! I'm so happy! Fufu, as soon as I relaxed, I lost all my strength...”
「あ……ううん、気にしないで。私は思いを伝えられただけでも満足……だから……」=“Ah... Nah, don't worry about it. I'm satisfied just being able to convey my feelings to you... that's why...”
「……繰り返しでごめん。私、キミのこと諦められないの。もう一度、お付き合いのこと、考えてくれないかな？」=“... I'm sorry to bring it up again. I just can't bring myself to give up on you. Can you think about our relationship once again?”
「え……ほ、本当？　あ……ふふっ、ありがとうっ！　こんなに嬉しいことってないわ！」=“Eh... R-really? Ah... Fufu, thank you! There isn't anything that could make me happier!”
「平気よ。分かってたことだから……でも……これからもキミのこと、好きでいさせて」=“I'm alright. I already knew... but... let me continue liking you.”
「あ、あのさ、[H名]とHしたいなって」=“I-I was thinking, I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「え？　冗談でしょ？　うそ、本気……なの？　ごめんなさい、さすがにそれは抵抗あるわね……」=“Eh? You're joking, right? No way, are you... serious? I'm sorry, I'll have to say no...”
「[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you, [H名].”
「もう……キミ、押せば何とかなるって思ってるでしょう？　まぁ、実際負けちゃうんだけど……ふふっ、いいわ、しましょ？」=“Geez... You think I'll eventually say yes if you keep at it for long enough, don't you? Well, I actually do feel like giving in... Fufu, alright, let's do it.”
「そういうのは無理よ。身体だけじゃなくて気持ちの問題もあるし……」=“That's impossible for me. It's not about the physical aspect, but it has to do with feelings...”
「ここで[H名]とHしたい」=“I want to have sex with you here, [H名].”
「人……いるわよ？　本気？　だったら……付き合うけど♪　そういうプレイ……私も興味あるもの」=“There are... people here though? Really? In that case... I'll go along with you ♪ This kind of fetish play... I've also been interested in it.”
「エッチっていうのは、人がいないところでするものよ？　秘め事っていうでしょう？」=“Isn't sex something you do in a place devoid of people? It's like a secret, right?”
「うそ、こんなところで？　でも……ふふっ、たまにはそういうスリルもいいかもね」=“No way, in a place like this? But... Fufu, sometimes fetish play like this is also fine I suppose.”
「ここでなんてダメよ。もう、勢い任せなんだから」=“A place like this is no good. Geez, I'll leave it to you then.”
「あ、あのねっ……実は私、すっごくエッチに興味があるの！　だから……その……して……くれないかな？」=“Y-you know... In all honesty, I'm actually really interested in sex! So that's why... that is... won't you... do it with me?”
「ありがとう。変な娘だって思われるかもしれないけど……こんなこと、キミにしか頼めなくて……」=“Thank you. I don't know if you think of me as a strange girl because of it but... something like this, there's no one I could ask except you...”
「わわっ、そ、そうよね！　ごめんなさい。私、ちょっとどうかしてたみたい……お願い、忘れて？」=“Wah, y-you're right! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me... Please, can you just forget about it?”
「これからお昼、一緒にどうかな？」=“How about we spend the lunch break together after this?”
「ええ、いいわよ。私もキミに声掛けようと思ってたところなの」=“Okay, alright. I was just thinking of calling you out myself.”
「ごめんなさい。今日はちょっと忙しくてあまり時間がないの。また今度誘ってね」=“I'm really sorry. I'm a bit busy today, so I have no time. Invite me out again sometime, alright?”
「今日のお昼は先約がいるかしら？　もしフリーなら一緒にどう？」=“Do you have plans with anyone for the lunch break today? If you're free, wanna spend it together?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。キミと一緒なら楽しいお昼が過ごせるの」=“Fufu, thank you. With you, I can pass the lunch break while having fun.”
「あら、残念……それじゃまた誘うわね」=“Oh, that's too bad... Then I'll invite you again some other time.”
「俺と一緒にコイカツしない？」=“Wanna do some koikatsu activites with me?”
「ふふっ、待ってたわ。それじゃどんなことをしましょうか？」=“Fufu, I was waiting for that. Then, what shall we do?”
「あ……ごめんなさい、今日は無理なの。今度、落ち着いてる時にまた……ね？」=“Ah... Sorry, I can't do it right now. Maybe once things have calmed down a bit, invite me again... okay?”
「コイカツって私からお願いしてもいいの？　だったら今からどうかしら？」=“Is it alright if I ask for us to do some Koikatsu activities? In that case, how about right now?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。それじゃ早速……何しましょうか？」=“Fufu, thank you. Then, what shall we do?”
「あらら、忙しかった……かな？　ううん、大丈夫。次はきっと……お願いね」=“Oh my, you were busy... I guess? Nah, it's alright. Then next time... alright?”
「今日、一緒に帰らない？」=“Wanna go home together?”
「ふふっ、いいわよ。タイミングばっちりだったわね」=“Fufu, sure. Your timing was perfect.”
「あ……今日はタイミング悪いわね。ごめんなさい」=“Ah... I have plans today so I can't. Sorry.”
「ね、もし良かったら一緒に帰らない？」=“Hey, if it's fine with you, wanna walk home together?”
「ふふっ、ありがとう。誰かと一緒に帰るのって楽しいわよね」=“Fufu, thank you. Walking home with someone else sure is fun, isn't it?”
「残念……それじゃ今日は一人で帰ろっかな。また誘うわね」=“That's too bad... Then, I suppose I'll walk home by myself today. I'll invite you out again next time.”
「もし良かったら、俺とデートしない？」=“If it's alright with you, wanna go on a date with me?”
「そういうのはちょっと早すぎるわよ。お互いにもっとよく知ってから……ね？」=“I think that's still a bit too fast for us. Maybe after we get to know each other better... okay?”
「俺、[H名]とデートしたいんだ。どうかな？」=“I really wanna go on a date with you, [H名]. How about it?”
「ええ、喜んで。私もデートが楽しいお年頃……ですもの。ふふっ♪」=“Okay, I'll gladly go. I'm just at that age too... where dating sounds like a fun time. Fufu ♪”
「あ……ごめん、最近忙しくて……決して嫌なわけじゃないの。本当よ？」=“Ah... Sorry. I've been a bit busy lately... It's not that I don't want to. Really.”
「……あのね、キミさえ良かったら……私とデートしない？」=“... Hey, if it's alright with you... wanna go on a date with me?”
「ありがとう！　こういうのって切り出す方が緊張するわね」=“Thank you! Just trying to bring it up made me so nervous.”
「そう……残念……でも次回に期待するわね」=“That so... that's too bad. But, I'll still be looking forward to the next time.”
「一緒に勉強しようよ」=“Let's study together.”
「ありがとう。私も誰かとしたかったの。一人だと集中出来なくて」=“Thank you. I've also been wanting to do it with someone else. I can't concentrate on it by myself.”
「ごめんね。勉強はしなきゃいけないんだけど、今は無理なの」=“I'm sorry. While I really want to study together, I can't do it today.”
「ね、たまには一緒に勉強なんてどうかしら？」=“Hey, how about we study together from time to time?”
「ふふっ、嬉しい。こういうの、学生らしくていいわよね」=“Fufu, I'm glad. Things like these, they really make me feel like I'm living my school life to the fullest.”
「うーん、一人で頑張れるかしら……なんて、大丈夫♪　今度またよろしくね」=“Hmm, I wonder if I can work hard by myself... Just kidding, it's alright ♪ I'll leave it up to you again.”
「これから運動するんだけど、よかったら一緒にどう？」=“I'm going to go get some exercise after this, if you'd like, wanna join me?”
「あら、いいわね。何となく身体を動かしたい気分だったの」=“Oh, sure. I've been feeling like stretching out my body for a while now anyway.”
「あ……ごめんね。今はそんなに元気がなくて……」=“Ah... Sorry. I'm not feeling super well right now...”
「もし良かったら、私と一緒に運動しない？」=“If it's alright with you, wanna exercise with me?”
「ありがとう！　男の子と身体動かすなんて、いい汗かけそうね」=“Thank you! Doing physical activities with a boy will surely make me work up quite the sweat.”
「あら、ダメだった？　それじゃまた今度お相手してね」=“Oh, is it no good? Then, maybe next time.”
「[H名]はコイカツ部に興味ない？　もし良かったら入って欲しいんだけど……」=“Hey, [H名], do you have any interest in the Koikatsu Club? If it's alright, I'd like for you to join...”
「ごめんなさい、もう少し考えてもいいかしら？」=“I'm sorry, can I have some more time to think about it?”
「あのね、私、コイカツ部のことが気になるの。入部希望なんだけど……いいかしら？」=“Hey, I'm a bit interested in the Koikatsu Club. I want to join... Can I?”
「付いてきてもらってもいい？」=“Hey, can you come with me?”
「ええ、どうしたの？」=“Alright, what is it?”
「待って待って。今は無理よ。ちょっと用事があるの」=“Wait, wait. I can't right now. I have something else to do.”
「こんなところに来て何する気？　もう……男の子って本当にエッチなんだから」=“What are you planning to do, bringing me to a place like this? Geez... boys are always only thinking about lewd things.”
「ねぇ、ここが女子トイレだって分かって入ってきたでしょ？　そう言うことしちゃ、めっ、よ？」=“Hey, you entered this place knowing this is the girl's toilet, right? You know that doing something like that is wrong, yes?”
「も、もうっ……こんなところで男子と一緒だなんて……誰かに見られたら絶対怪しまれるでしょ」=“G-geez... Being in a place like this with a boy... If someone saw us, they'll definitely think we're doing something suspicious...”
「キミはこんな場所に興味があるヘンタイさんなのかしら？　ん？」=“Having an interest in a place like this, are you a pervert? Hmm?”
「ごめん、キミとは話す時間もないし興味もないの」=“Sorry, I don't have neither the time to talk to you nor an interest in doing so.”
「ふんだ。こう見えて結構怒ってるんですからね」=“Hmph. Even though it may not seem like it, I'm actually quite angry right now.”
「ごめんね……時間がある時に、またゆっくり話しましょう」=“I'm sorry... Let's catch up properly when I have some free time.”
「こ、こういうの……改めて見られるのって……恥ずかしいのよ？」=“T-this is... being seen like this... It's really embarrassing, you know?”
「こらこら、そんなにジロジロ見ないの。キミ、軽蔑されちゃうわよ？」=“Hey, hey, don't stare at me like that. I'll start hating you at this rate, you know?”
「え、えっと……どうかしら？　なによ、お姉さんだって緊張くらいするんだから」=“U-um... What is it? Don't stare like that, this onee-san gets nervous easily.”
「へぇ、女子の水着……そんなに興味あるんだ。まったく……男の子ってどうしようもないんだから」=“Huh, so a you were that interested... in the girls' swimsuit. Seriously... boys really can't be helped...”
「あ、キミも来たのね。こういう日の屋上って最高よね。一緒にくつろぎましょ」=“Ah, you came as well, huh? Being on the roof on a day like this sure is great, isn't it? Let's  relax together.”
「ふふっ、なんていうか……廊下で会えただけでも嬉しいなって思っちゃう……私、変なのかも」=“Fufu, for some reason... just meeting like this in the hallway makes me so incredibly happy... Maybe I'm strange...”
「静かな場所でキミと一緒……ふふっ、考えただけでドキドキするわね」=“Being in a quiet place, together with you... Fufu, just thinking about it makes my heart throb so fast.”
「何かしら？　二人きりじゃないと話せないことなのよね？」=“What is it? It's something we can't talk about unless we're alone, isn't it?”
「こらこら待ちなさい。そんなとこに入ったら冗談じゃすまなくなるわよ？」=“Hey, wait, stop right there. If you enter a place like that, I won't be able to excuse it as just a joke, okay?”
「ふふっ、キミとのデート、すごく楽しみ……私にだって乙女チックな妄想くらいあるのよ？」=“Fufu, a date with you, I'm looking so forward to it... Even I get girly fantasies too, you know?”
「キミと一緒にいる時の私、自分でも舞い上がっちゃってるなぁって思うわ。恥ずかしい……」=“Whenever I'm with you, I get so excited that I surprise myself. It's so embarrassing...”
「今まで男の子の知り合いって少なかったから……その……色々なとこ、気になっちゃうな」=“I've never been all that close to many male friends until now so... that is... There's lots of things I'm so curious about.”
「キミが見てくれるなら、はりきって活躍しなきゃね」=“With you watching me like that, I can't help but also want to enthusiastically do some club activities.”
「あら、見学に来てくれたの？　もしかして私に会いに来てくれた……とか？」=“Oh, came to take a look at the club? Or did you come here to see me... perhaps?”
「今コイカツ中なの？　ふふっ、部長さんは大忙しね。応援してるわ」=“Busy with Koikatsu club activities? Fufu, the club president is always so busy. I'll be cheering you on.”
「ふぅ、ようやく長い休み時間……ここでしっかりリフレッシュしなきゃね」=“Fuu, finally a long break... Should properly relax and refresh while we can.”
「最近思うんだけど……学生にとってのメインイベントって、やっぱり放課後じゃないかしら？」=“I've been thinking this for a while now but... the main event of the day for any student has to be the after-school free time, no?”
「ひゃぁんっ！？　あ、キミ……も、もう……ちょっとエッチな声聞かれちゃった♪」=“Hyan!? Ah, it's you... g-geez... you made me let out such a lewd voice ♪”
「ふふっ、今日はどんなお話出来るのかしら？　キミとだったら毎回新鮮よ」=“Fufu, what shall we talk about today? If it's with you, no matter what we talk about, it always seems fresh.”
「家に帰ったらすぐ部屋着になるタイプ？」=“Are you the type to change into loungewear as soon as you get home?”
「うーん、そうね。こう見えてわりとゴロゴロしちゃうの。だから部屋着……かな」=“Well, yeah. Even if I seem like this, I actually lounge about a lot at home. That's why it's called loungewear... I guess.”
「ううん、まずは私服に着替えるわ。だってまたコンビニとかに出かけるかもしれないし……ね？」=“No, I generally tend to dress into plain clothes instead. After all, you never know if you might have to go to a convenience store or whatever... you know?”
「わりと夜更かしとかする？」=“Do you stay up late often?”
「するする。夜中のテレビって面白くって……お肌には良くないんだけどね……」=“I do, I do. I really like watching late night shows. Although, I hear it's not good for your skin to stay up late...”
「実は私、夜に弱いの。すぐに眠くなっちゃって……あー、お子様だって思ったでしょう？」=“Actually, I'm rather bad at doing that. I always feel super sleepy at night... Ah, you think I'm just like a little kid, don't you?”
「行ってみたい場所とかある？」=“Is there any place you'd like to visit?”
「ええ、あるわよ。ちょっと遠くの温泉なんだけど……キミ、いつか一緒に行ってくれる？」=“Yes, there is. It's a hot spring quite a ways away from here... Wanna go there together sometime?”
「私って意外とインドア派なのよ。だからあんまり遠出に興味はないかな」=“I'm actually quite the indoor type. That's why, I don't really have that much of an interest in visiting far away places.”
「アニメとか見るのかな？」=“Do you watch things like anime?”
「実は結構見るのよ。そしてよく泣いちゃったり……えー、最近のは本当に泣けるんだってばー」=“Actually, I watch a lot of anime. I cry a lot watching it too... Ehh, it really does make me cry a lot lately.”
「アニメよりは洋画を観ることが多いわね。吹き替えじゃなくて字幕派よ」=“Rather than anime, I actually watch a lot of western movies. Also, rather than dubs, I prefer subs.”
「あ、そういう話題はちょっと……違うこと話そっか」=“Ah, that topic is a bit... let's talk about something else.”
「この間、たまたま布団を干してきた時に限って……」=“Recently, sometimes, but only when my futon is being aired out...”
「あぁ……降っちゃうわよね……うん、早退するわけにもいかないし……がっかりよね……」=“Aahh... It starts pouring or snowing... Yeah, it's not like you can leave class early to take care of it either... It's so disappointing isn't it...”
「あのさ、たまには俺も『お姉さん』って呼んでみていい？」=“Hey, do you mind if I call you "onee-san" sometimes too?”
「別に構わないけど……キミ、そういうのが好きなの？」=“I don't particularly mind but... I didn't know you liked that sort of thing.”
「もしかして恋愛に溺れるタイプ？」=“Are you perhaps the type to lose your head over things like love?”
「そ、そうよ。悪い？　ふんだ、どうせキミに出会うまでは気付きませんでしたよーだ。もう……大好きっ♪」=“T-that's right. Is that bad? Hmph, it's not like I cared that much about it before I met you anyway. Geez... I love you ♪”
「お姉さんがそういうタイプに見える？　しっかり自立した女性でしょ？　もう」=“Does this onee-san really look like that type of person to you? Don't you actually mean an independent woman instead? Geez.”
「連絡はマメな方がいい？」=“Would it be better for me to contact you often?”
「そうねぇ……あんまり連絡がないと寂しいし、心配しちゃうかしら。あ、もちろんキミはマメにしてくれるわよね？」=“Yeah, probably... I'd feel lonely if I wasn't, I'd also start worrying. Ah, of course, you'll keep in touch a lot too, right?”
「私自身が筆無精だしなぁ。メールとか結構苦手だし……一日一回とかでも満足よ？」=“For me, I'm not the type that likes typing very much, and I'm not that good with email and such either... I'm fine with just once per day, you know?”
「恋人に求める、絶対に譲れない条件とかある？」=“For a potential lover, is there anything in particular you'd never let go?”
「そんなの……私が好きになる人、に決まってるわ。そして願わくば、私を好きになってくれる人、ね」=“That's... It has to be someone that I fell in love with, of course. And if possible, that person would love me back.”
「特にないかな。条件とか考えなくても、気付いたら好きになっちゃってたもの。なっちゃってたもの！」=“Not particularly. Before I could even think about any sort of qualifications, I realized I had already fallen in love. I've already fallen in love!”
「彼氏のこと、格好いいって思ってる？」=“About your boyfriend, do you think he's cool?”
「へぇ、それを聞いちゃいますか……仕方ないなぁ、もう……ふふっ、世界で一番、格好いいって思ってるわよ♪」=“Huh, you really wanna hear that... Guess it can't be helped, geez... Fufu, I think you're the coolest person in the whole world ♪”

「特殊な性癖とかってある？」=“Do you have any particularly peculiar fetishes or anything?”
「えっと……敢えて言うならＢＬ……うそ、ごめんなさい、何でもない！　何でもないったらー！」=“Um... If I have to pick, I suppose BL... That's a lie, I'm sorry, it was nothing! I'm saying that it isn't!”
「そんなこと自分じゃ分かんないわよー。みんな自分のことはノーマルだと思ってるものよ？」=“Something like that, I don't think anyone really knows about themselves. Doesn't everyone think themselves as normal?”
「背中って感じるかな？」=“Do you feel any sensations in your back?”
「ぞくぞくはしちゃうけど……それって感じるってことなの？　あ、なにその目、やらしいんだから」=“I do feel a shiver down it but... Is that what you meant by "feel"? Ah, what's with those lewd eyes?”
「触ると痒くならない？　うそ、私だけ？　やーん、ムードなくてごめんなさい」=“Doesn't it feel itchy when touched? No way, is it just me? Ehh, sorry, I'm not in the mood right now.”
「自分はＭだと思う？」=“Do you think you're an M?”
「うーん、女の子って基本はＭの娘が多いんじゃないかしら？　あ、あくまで一般論よ？」=“Well, don't you think that generally there are a lot of girls who are masochists? T-that's just a regular guess though.”
「ふふっ、私は間違いなくドＳね。キミのこと、いっぱい苛めたいもの……って、本気で答えたらどうする気なの？」=“Fufu, I am unmistakably a hard S. I really want to tease you all day... If I actually replied with that seriously, what would you do?”
「鏡とかでさ、自分のアソコをじっくり見たことある？」=“Hey, have you ever, by using a mirror or whatever, properly taken a look down there?”
「恥ずかしいこと平気で聞くんだから……その、あるわ。だって、気になったんだもの……」=“You really ask the most embarrassing things so easily... Yes, I've done that. I mean, I was curious...”
「じっくりと見たことは……って、なに真面目に答えてるの、私！」=“I have taken a good... Wait, why am I answering this so seriously!?”
「今、恥ずかしい話はちょっと……他のこと話しましょう」=“Talking about such embarrassing things is a bit... Let's talk about something else.”
「エッチって……なんだろうね」=“I wonder... what is sex, really?”
「哲学？　よく分からないけど、キミがにやにやしてることだけは分かるわね」=“An interest in philosophy? I don't really get it myself, but I do know that you're grinning from ear-to-ear.”
「この間、道ばたにエッチな道具が落ちてて……」=“The other day, I saw some sex toys on the side o the road...”
「ど、どんな道具かしら……男性用？　女性用？　あっ、ち、違うのよ。ちょっと気になっただけ」=“W-what kind of toys... For men? For women? Ah, i-it's not like that. I was just a bit curious, that's all.”
「友達からね、恋人よりは姉にしたいタイプって言われちゃった。そうかしら？」=“I heard from a friend, that I'm more of an elder sister type rather than a lover type. Is that really so?”
「むぅ……キミも姉にしたいのね。姉で恋人？　や、やだ……それはちょっと……いいかも♪」=“Muuu... You think so too, huh. Older sister and lover? N-no... That might be a bit... good ♪”
「ふふっ、そうよね。私だって女の子なんだから。きちんと恋人になりたいのよ」=“Fufu, that's right. I'm a girl too in the end. I want to properly become someone's lover.”
「恋愛において、キミはリードする方……なのかな？」=“Regarding love and stuff, are you the type... that takes the lead?”
「ふふっ、だったら全部お任せしちゃおうかしら。私、そういうことに疎くって」=“Fufu, then maybe I'll leave it all to you. I'm not good with that sort of stuff anyway.”
「ええ、リードされたいの？　どうしよう……私、これからいっぱい勉強しなきゃ」=“Ehh, you want me to take the lead? What should I do... I think I'll have to start studying really hard.”
「エッチしててもプラトニックな関係って……あるわよね？」=“There are those types of people who are in a platonic relationship but they have sex together... aren't there?”
「ふふっ、そうよね。肉体関係＝不純ってわけじゃないものね」=“Fufu, that's true. Sexual relations aren't automatically impure, are they?”
「うーん、やっぱりそうなのかしら。身体のことが絡むと、どうしても欲望が前面に出ちゃうものね」=“Well, I suppose that's true. If you have a relationship like that, desires always come out to the forefront, don't they.”
「ね、ちょっとだけ手を握ってもいい？」=“Hey, is it alright if we hold hands for a bit?”
「うん、いいよ」=“Yeah, that's fine.”
「はぁ……やっぱり男の子の手って全然違うんだ……何度触っても感動しちゃうわ」=“Hah... As expected, a boy's hand is completely different from a girl's hand... No matter how many times I touch it... it gets me so excited...”
「昨日、寝る前にキミのことを考えてみたの」=“Last night, before I went to sleep, I was thinking about you.”
「え……まさかエッチな……」=“Eh... It wasn't lewd stuff, was it...?”
「違うわよ！　もう、どうしてすぐそういう方向にいくのかしら」=“No, not at all! Jeez, why do you always automatically jump to that conclusion.”
「最近ね、大人っぽくなったって言われるの。どうかな？」=“Recently, people have been telling me that I've become more mature. What do you think?”
「うーん、出会った頃からわりと大人っぽかったよ？」=“Well, you've been pretty mature ever since we met.”
「そうよね。私もそう思うんだけど……。自覚はなくても、やっぱり恋愛すると変わるのかしら……？」=“That seems true. I think so too... I suppose even if you don't notice it, you're bound to change when you fall in love...”
「ねぇ……今から言う質問は絶対他言しちゃダメよ？　絶対よ？　あのね……私のおっぱい……好き？」=“Hey... The question I'm about to ask, promise me you won't tell anyone else, alright? Just... well... My boobs... do you like them?”
「ふふっ、嬉しい。これからますます大きくなって、キミ好みになったらいいなぁ」=“Fufu, I'm glad. It would be great if they continued getting bigger and becoming more of your type”
「ありがとう。ちょうど良いサイズって言われるの、すごく嬉しい！」=“Thank you. Hearing you say that they're the perfect size, it makes me really happy!”
「実は小さくてコンプレックスだったんだけど……キミがそう言ってくれるなら、もう自慢のおっぱいね」=“Actually, I've always had a bit of a complex about how small they are... but if you say that, then these breasts are something I can finally be proud of.”
「私くらいの身長って……キミの好みに合ってるのかしら？」=“Girls about my height... Do they match your tastes?”
「今までヒールは履かなかったけど、これからはいっぱい履いちゃおうかしら」=“I've never worn heels in my life, but I suppose I'll start doing so now.”

「特徴ない体型だけど、キミが褒めてくれるなら……それでいいの。ふふっ」=“It's not a particularly impressive figure, but if you're praising me like this, then it's alright I suppose. Fufu”
「太りたくても太れない体質だから……そう言ってもらえると嬉しい。これからも維持するからね」=“I have a constitution where I can't put on weight even if I want to, so hearing you say that makes me happy. I'll keep trying.”
「そうなの……？　お姉さん、ちょっとだけ寂しいなー……なんて」=“Really...? Onee-san feels a tad bit lonely... Just kidding”
「キミはまず恋人に対して何をするべきか、よく考えてみることね」=“You should try and think a bit harder about what you ought to do for your lover.”
「うん、こちらこそごめんなさい。本当はすごく寂しかったの……」=“Yeah, I'm sorry too. The truth is, I've just been so lonely...”
「ねぇ、謝れば許してもらえると思ってない？　そうやって適当になっていくのが嫌なのに……」=“Hey, do you really think that I'll forgive you if you just apologize? It's exactly that kind of half-assed behaviour of yours that I hate...”
「ん？　なになに？　どうしたの？」=“Hmm? What? Something the matter?”
「もう、そうやってお姉さんを困らせないの。恥ずかしいでしょ」=“Jeez, Don't make your onee-san worried like that. It's embarrassing.”
「一体何が目的なのかしら？　お姉さん、深読みしちゃうからダメよ？」=“Just what on earth are you intending? I'll start reading too much into things, so don't do that”
「こら、今絶対エッチなこと考えてたでしょう？　気付かないと思ってるの？」=“Hey, just now, you were definitely thinking about lewd stuff, weren't you? You really think that I'm dense enough to not notice it?”
「男の子ってそんなにおっぱい好きなの？　それともキミが特別？」=“Do boys really love breasts that much? Or is it that you're a unique specimen?”
「やだ、私の彼氏って……もしかしておっぱいと付き合いたい人なのかしら……？」=“No way, my boyfriend... Is he really the type to go out with a walking pair of tits if he could...?”
「ねぇ、私はキミに謝って欲しいの。単純、簡単、明快、でしょ？」=“Hey, I want you to apologize to me. Simple, Quick and Uncomplicated, right?”
「わわっ、もうっ……前置きなしでいきなり……ううん、嫌じゃないよ♪」=“W-Woah, Jeez... No beating around the bush, huh?... No, I don't hate it ♪”
「何度も握られるのはちょっと……恥ずかしいよ？」=“Being grabbed like this again and again is a bit... embarrassing, you know?”
「何回もにぎにぎしないの！　こういうのはほら……そういう雰囲気の時にやることよ？」=“Stop grabbing me like this again and again! Things like this... We should only do it in, uh, that, kind of mood”
「やんっ……こ、こらっ、いくら恋人でもダメでしょ」=“Hyan... H-Hey, Cut it out, even if we're lovers, this kind of thing is no good.”
「うそ……キミ、そういうこと平気で出来ちゃう人なのっ……？」=“No way... Are you someone who lets it out that easily?”
「もう……お姉さん、本気で呆れちゃうわよ？　いいの？　これからそういう目で見ちゃうわよ？」=“Jeez... This onee-chan will actually get disgusted for real. Are you alright with that? Do you want me to look at you with those kinds of eyes?”
「あ……ふふっ、こういうのは嬉しいかも……」=“Ah... Fufu, this makes me happy...”
「はわっ、な、ナデナデ繰り返されると……甘えたくなっちゃう……」=“Hawa... I-If you keep patting me like that... I'll become spoiled...”
「さすがに恥ずかしいわよ。ほら、私だってもう立派に大人な女性なんだからー！」=“That's really embarrassing. After all, I'm a proper mature woman too--!”
「ひゃんっ……触られちゃっ……た……♪」=“Hyan~... I got felt... up... ♪”
「うーん、何が目的なのかしら？　ほっぺたの柔らかさは胸と一緒……じゃないわよね？」=“Hmm, I wonder what your aim is? You're not comparing the softness of my cheeks to my chest... right?”
「もうダメ！　ほっぺた触られる度にキスされるんじゃないかってドキドキするんだからー！」=“Cut it out with that! I'm getting too excited just wondering if you're going to kiss me everytime you touch my cheeks!”
「そういうことするなら、きちんと仲直りした後じゃないと嫌……かな」=“Unless you're gonna apologize and make up with me, doing something like that is a bit... I don't like it.”
「キミの近くにいればいるほどキミのこと好きになっちゃう。魔法みたいね」=“I've fallen in love with you to the point that just being next to you is enough. It's like magic.”
「キミが男の子だから……なのかな。私、いつも胸がドキドキして……身体、熱くなっちゃうの……」=“I wonder if it's because you're a boy... When I'm with you, my chest always starts throbbing... and my body becomes hot...”
「キミのこと、全部知りたくなっちゃった。たくさんお話しましょ？」=“I've become even more interested in you, to the point of wanting to know everything about you. Let's talk lots, okay?”
「ふふっ、キミのお顔をじっくり見てもいい時間ね。へぇ……肌綺麗なんだ……」=“Fufu, just gazing at your face is fun as well. Heh... it's so pretty...”
「私とは話すこともない……ってことかしら？」=“Is it that... there's nothing to talk about with me?”
「私、ちょっと限界かも……お互いに一度頭を冷やしてみましょう」=“I... think I've hit my limit... Let's both take some time to cool off.”
「ね……どうして私がこんな気分なのか……分かってくれる……わよね？　そうじゃなきゃ……ううん、なんでもない。それじゃ」=“Hey... I wonder why I'm feeling like this... you understand... right? If not... No, it's nothing. Then, see ya.”
「どうしてかしら？　どんどんキミの傍に近づきたくなっちゃう。私、引き寄せられてるみたい……またお話しましょうね」=“I wonder why it is? For some reason, I keep wanting to get even closer to you... It feels like I'm being pulled... Let's talk again sometime, alright?”
「あのね……キミといると、私、初めての気持ちになるの……大きな声じゃ言えない気持ちよ？　あはは、それじゃ、またね！」=“Hey, you know... When I'm with you, I feel these feelings that I've never felt before... Feelings that I can't say out loud... Ahaha, then, let's meet again!”
「ふふっ、そろそろ切り上げないといつまでも話しちゃいそうね。また次も楽しみにしてるわね」=“Fufu, if we don't cut it short here, we'll keep talking forever. I'm looking forward to the next time~”
「うん、このままだとずーっと話しちゃいそうだものね。またいつでも声をかけて」=“Yeah, at this rate, we'll end up talking all day. Call for me again sometime.”
「ええ、それじゃ。またね」=“Alright, then, next time.”

「あのさ、俺、ここで[H名]とエッチしたいんだ」=“Hey, Listen, I really wanna have sex with you, [H名], right here.”
「こんな場所で……もうヘンタイさんね……って、ふふっ、私もしたいんだけど♪」=“In a place like this... You're such a pervert... Well, Fufu, It's not like I don't want to do it either ♪”
「あのね、キミは世間体と欲望のバランスを考えた方がいいわ。こんなとこじゃダーメ」=“Hey, you should think properly about balancing your desires and public decency. Doing it in this place is no good.”
「うそ……万が一人のことがあったら……って、ふふっ、それも楽しそうね。いいわよ、しましょ♪」=“No way... What if someone walks in... Well, Fufu, That sounds fun in its own way. Alright, let's do it ♪”
「もう……こういうところは安心して出来ないからダメなの。エッチはゆっくりしっかりするもの、でしょ？」=“Jeez... We can't do it in a place like this, I can't relax here. Sex is something we should take our time with and do properly, no?”
